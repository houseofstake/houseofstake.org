<p>The technologies we and our service providers use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong> Cookies are small text files stored through a browser on a computing or mobile device. Cookies help you navigate website pages efficiently and may improve your user experience. Note that while you can set your browser to not allow cookies, we and our service providers may not be able to honor that request, and may track your activity and collect information about you and your online activities even when the browser is set to “do not track”;</li>
<li><strong>Flash Cookies</strong>. Certain features of the Website, the Apps and the Tools may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on the Website, the Apps and the Tools. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies and you may not be able to shut down our and our service providers’ collection of and use of information through this technology;</li>
<li><strong>Web Beacons, Pixels and Tags.</strong> Pages of the Website, the Apps and the Tools, and our and our service providers’ e-mails, may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us and our service providers, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain content and verifying system and server integrity);</li>
<li><strong>Embedded Scripts</strong>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Website, the Apps and the Tools, such as information about the links you click on;</li>
<li><strong>ETag, or entity tag</strong>. An ETag, or entity tag, is a feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. It is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for web cache validation. These allow websites to be more efficient and not serve content again, when data is already cached and ready to view;</li>
<li><strong>Fingerprinting</strong>. Fingerprinting refers to the collection and analysis of information from your device, such as your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification;</li>
<li><strong>Recognition Technologies</strong>. Recognition technologies refers to various technology features used by websites, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user); and</li>
<li><strong>Log Files</strong>. These track actions occurring on the Website, the Apps and the Tools, which help us and our service providers collect your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, the webpages from which you came or to which you go before and after visiting the Website, the Apps and the Tools, and the date and time of your visits.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="behavioral-advertising"><strong>Behavioral Advertising</strong></h1>
<p>We and our service providers may use your personal information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications that we each believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“<strong>NAI</strong>”) educational page at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work">http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work</a>.</p>
<h1 id="do-not-track"><strong>Do Not Track</strong></h1>
<p>Do Not Track (“<strong>DNT</strong>”) is a concept promoted by certain regulatory authorities and industry groups for development and implementation of a mechanism that would allow internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites. Currently, various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that allows a user to set a preference in the browser to not have his/her activities on the internet tracked. You can usually access your browser&#x27;s DNT option in your browser&#x27;s preferences. When a user’s browser is set to DNT, some cookies and other tracking technologies may become inactive, depending on how the website visited responds to DNT browser settings. If that occurs, the website visited will not recognize you upon return to that website, save your passwords or user names, and some other features of a website may become unavailable or not function properly.</p>
<h1 id="third-party-use-of-cookies-and-other-tracking-technologies"><strong>Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></h1>
<p>Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website, the Apps and the Tools may be served by third-parties (in addition to our service providers who provide the Tools), including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Website, the Apps and the Tools. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.</p>
<p>We and our service providers do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.</p>

Keep in mind that if you use the same password for all websites, if someone obtains your credentials for one site, they may be able to then use those credentials to log into any other site you use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we and our service providers try to protect your personal information, we and our service providers cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through or collected through the use of the Website, the Apps and the Tools.
