# What is veNEAR

**veNEAR (vote-escrowed NEAR)** is a governance token that allows NEAR holders to participate in House of Stake governance through a stake-weighted, time-locked mechanism.

By locking NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR tokens, users receive veNEAR. The longer the lock duration, the greater the voting power received. This aligns incentives for long-term commitment and active participation.

## Key Characteristics

- **Non-transferable**: veNEAR cannot be transferred or traded.
- **Time-weighted voting power**: Voting power increases with the duration of the lock â€” no minimum or maximum period required.
- **Multi-asset support**: Users can lock NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR to receive veNEAR.

## Purpose of veNEAR

- Aligning stakeholders over the long-term to influence the direction of NEAR governance.
- Provide a clear and predictable incentive structure via reward distribution.
- Encourage thoughtful participation and discourage manipulation.

## Why It Matters

veNEAR creates strong alignment between governance power and economic commitment. Those who lock assets for longer periods gain more influence, encouraging responsible, engaged decision-making that supports the long-term health of the NEAR ecosystem.
