# Versioning & Evolution

House of Stake is designed as an evolving governance system. To stay relevant, it must be able to improve over time — without losing stability or trust.

## On-chain Versioning

Each major governance change (new roles, voting rules, funding mechanisms) is treated as a version upgrade.
These changes are proposed and approved through the same proposal and voting process.

- All version changes are tracked on-chain
- Each version is publicly documented
- Participants can review historical changes and rationale

## Why Versioning Matters

- Promotes transparency and continuity
- Prevents abrupt, undocumented changes
- Creates shared memory for governance evolution

## Community-Driven Iteration

Governance is never "final."
The House of Stake framework is open to experimentation, improvements, and new ideas — as long as they are proposed, reviewed, and voted on transparently.
