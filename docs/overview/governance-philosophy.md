# Governance Philosophy

The philosophy behind House of Stake is rooted in three principles:

1. **Stake-based legitimacy** — Those with more skin in the game should have more influence. Governance decisions should reflect the interests of long-term ecosystem participants who are economically and reputationally invested in NEAR.

2. **Transparency and accountability** — All governance actions must be traceable, documented, and open to review. Proposals, votes, and delegate activity are recorded on-chain and made publicly accessible.

3. **Efficiency without centralization** — Governance should be fast and effective — without becoming centralized. Pre-screening, delegate specialization, and clear processes help reduce noise while preserving decentralization.

This philosophy is a direct response to the shortcomings of earlier models like the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC), where equal voting rights led to low participation and diluted accountability.

House of Stake aims to strike a balance between **economic alignment**, **open participation**, and **pragmatic execution**, ensuring governance is both meaningful and manageable.
