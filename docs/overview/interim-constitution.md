# NEAR House of Stake - Interim Constitution (v0.1.0)

---

## Article 1 — Foundational Provisions

**1.1. Purpose**  
The NEAR House of Stake ("HoS") is the stake-weighted governance system of NEAR that exists to preserve neutrality, legitimacy, and resilience by enabling meaningful, stake-aligned participation.

**1.2. Binding Effect**  
Rules may be enforced onchain or off-chain; all rules adopted under this Constitution are binding.

**1.3. Supremacy**  
This Constitution is the supreme governance document for NEAR House of Stake - the decentralized network of veNEAR tokenholders. In the event of conflict with any policy, charter, or guideline, this Constitution supersedes their controls unless amended under Article 9. *(Referring to DAO ratified policy & charters, excludes NEAR House of Stake Foundation bylaws.)*

## Article 2 — Mandate

### 2.1 Economic Governance

**2.1.1.** Treasury management  
**2.1.2.** Programs to support economic sustainability  
**2.1.3.** Economic parameters:
- **2.1.3.1.** Inflation
- **2.1.3.2.** Fee switch for AI products, intents, etc.

### 2.2 Technical Governance

**2.2.1.** Incremental, narrow scope to begin  
**2.2.2.** e.g., MPC signers for chain signatures  
**2.2.3.** Determine which NEAR Enhancement Proposals (NEPs) should be escalated to HoS  
**2.2.4.** Anything that can't be governed on GitHub

### 2.3 Build Legitimacy

**2.3.1.** Maximize the amount of NEAR/veNEAR in the system  
**2.3.2.** Participation by broad subset of the community  
**2.3.3.** Decentralise Screening Committee  
**2.3.4.** Put in place policy: mission, vision, values, constitution, charters, policy, co-creation cycles

### 2.4 Grow Engagement and Ecosystem Health

**2.4.1.** In the DAO, in governance, in the protocol, in NEAR ecosystem more broadly  
**2.4.2.** Decentralized stakeholders participate in governance

### 2.5 Anti-Mandates

The following are **explicit anti-mandates**, i.e., things to avoid:

**2.5.1.** Grants for the sake of grants. House of Stake won't have an official "grants program" for now, and there won't be a free-for-all for funding requests. Proposals that target the above mandate items may, of course, include requests for funding for specific uses.

**2.5.2.** Full technical governance of the NEAR protocol, or of other products including Chain Signatures, NEAR Intents, and NEAR AI. These products are all extraordinarily complex and House of Stake doesn't have the necessary technical expertise, and isn't well positioned, to own this anytime soon. We'll start with less complex technical governance tasks, such as the one outlined above: governing the Chain Signatures MPC signer set, and build capacity to take on more technical governance in the future.

## Article 3 — Membership & Rights

**3.1. Citizens**  
All NEAR holders are Citizens by default; they must lock their NEAR or eligible liquid staking token to become a **veNEAR holder** (registered voter) with rights to delegate or participate where allowed. 

Official NEAR House of Stake Contracts:
> venear-contract (venear.dao)  
> voting-contract (vote.dao)

**3.2. Registered Voters**

### 3.2.1. Voter Rights

  - **3.2.1.6.2.** Conflict with NEAR House of Stake Foundation Articles or Bylaws
  - **3.2.1.6.3.** Risk of legal or reputational harm

### 3.2.2. Terminology Alignment

For the avoidance of doubt, all references to "veNEAR holder," "Registered Voter," or "Citizen (veNEAR participant)" are equivalent during the interim period.
