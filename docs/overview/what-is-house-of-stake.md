# What is House of Stake

The **House of Stake (HoS)** is a governance framework designed to empower NEAR token holders through a transparent, efficient, and stake-weighted decision-making system.

Instead of a one-person-one-vote model, HoS introduces a more sustainable and long-term approach based on **veNEAR** â€” a vote-escrowed token that rewards long-term commitment and alignment.

HoS was created to address common challenges in decentralized governance, such as low engagement, lack of transparency, and misaligned incentives.

Key components include:

- **Stake-weighted voting** via veNEAR
- **Pre-screening of proposals** by a Screening Committee
- A **delegate system** with clear roles and aligned incentives
- **Structured funding** sourced from 0.5% protocol inflation
- **On-chain voting** and transparent processes

The vision of HoS is to build a sustainable, decentralized, and user-owned governance system that can evolve alongside the needs of the NEAR ecosystem.

This documentation explains how House of Stake works, how to get involved, and how it will help shape the future of NEAR governance.
