# Why This Matters

Governance is infrastructure.
Without reliable and transparent decision-making, even the best technology and ecosystems can fail.

House of Stake was created in response to the challenges observed in earlier governance efforts — especially around low engagement, slow processes, and poor incentive alignment.

## Key Problems It Aims to Solve

- **Lack of participation:** One-person-one-vote models often result in voter apathy
- **Inefficient execution:** Unclear roles and open-ended debates stall progress
- **Misaligned incentives:** Participants have little reason to stay active or long-term committed
- **Opaque decisions:** Important calls happen off-chain and without community oversight

## Why Stake-Weighted Governance?

Stake-weighted systems, like those powered by veNEAR, align influence with long-term commitment.
They help ensure that governance is shaped by those with meaningful investment in the network's future — not just short-term incentives.

House of Stake isn’t perfect — but it’s a step toward governance that is sustainable, open, and focused on outcomes.
