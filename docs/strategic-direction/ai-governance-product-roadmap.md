# AI Governance Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the current direction of **AI Governance** within **House of Stake**, based on the document [AI Governance Product Roadmap](https://gov.near.org/t/ai-governance-product-roadmap/41683).

It describes three key phases in the evolution of AI-driven governance — **Support, Represent, Organize** — each corresponding to a core product: **Proposal Dashboard**, **Delegate Agent**, and **Manager Agent**.

---

### **Phase 1: Support — Proposal Dashboard**

The first phase focuses on enhancing human participation in governance.
**Proposal Dashboard** is an intelligent platform that helps authors, reviewers, and the community work with proposals more effectively and transparently.

AI capabilities include:
- Evaluating and summarizing proposals based on clarity, completeness, and mission alignment;
- Helping authors refine structure, reasoning, and relevance;
- Supporting reviewers by identifying risks, gaps, and promising ideas.

At this stage, AI acts as a **co-pilot for governance** — augmenting human decision-making rather than replacing it.

### **Phase 2: Represent — Delegate Agent**

The second phase introduces **representation through autonomous, customizable AI agents**.
**Delegate Agent** is a transparent AI delegate that participates in voting, informed by Proposal Dashboard evaluations and user-defined principles.

It enables:
- Automated yet auditable participation in governance processes;
- Transparent reasoning and traceable decision logic;
- Personalization and adaptive learning through user feedback.

This phase makes governance **scalable and accessible**, allowing every participant to be represented — even without direct, constant involvement.

---

### **Phase 3: Organize — Manager Agent**

The final phase focuses on **coordination and organizational management** within DAOs.
**Manager Agent** can manage committee membership, roles, and responsibilities in real time, based on objective and transparent criteria.

It enables DAOs to:
- Automate role and membership management;
- Prevent capture and improve accountability;
- Scale through flexible, autonomous decision-making groups.

Here, AI agents don’t replace human judgment — they help determine **who decides and how**, enabling a dynamic, self-organizing governance model.

---

### **Conclusion**

This roadmap defines a pathway for integrating AI into decentralized governance — from support and analysis to autonomous coordination.
**House of Stake** views artificial intelligence as a means to **enhance human participation and transparency**, building the foundation for governance that grows with the ecosystem and its collective values.
