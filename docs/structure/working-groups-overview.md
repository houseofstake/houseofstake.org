# Working Groups Overview

House of Stake is organized around several specialized Working Groups (WGs), each focused on a core area of governance and ecosystem development.

These groups are responsible for driving discussions, developing strategy, and coordinating execution in their respective domains. While delegates vote on proposals, WGs help shape those proposals and provide the expertise and operational support needed to make governance work.

## Current Working Groups

- **Ecosystem Growth**
  Drive user adoption and engagement, boost liquidity and token utility, expand and retain builders, improve NEAR’s visibility and integration across the stack.

- **Treasury Strategy & Management**
  Effectively utilize NEAR treasury resources.

- **Governance Infrastructure & Processes**
  Draft proposal structure, outline voting procedures & other operational governance processes, work towards defining DAO North Star objectives, break down governance OKRs into actionable items.

- **Network Economics & Security**
  Steward communication between the NEAR community, relevant stakeholders, and Gauntlet — focusing on the implications of a potential reduction of validator issuance on decentralization and validator sustainability.

Each group operates semi-independently, collaborates with delegates, and publishes progress updates regularly.

Community members can engage with WGs through forums, discussions, or proposals.
