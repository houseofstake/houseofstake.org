# Delegates & Participants {#delegates-participants}

In House of Stake, **delegates** play a central role in executing governance on behalf of veNEAR holders. They are trusted participants who vote on proposals, help shape the future of the ecosystem, and are expected to act transparently and responsibly.

## Delegates {#delegates}

Delegates receive voting power when other veNEAR holders delegate their tokens to them. To become a delegate, a user must meet certain requirements and publicly commit to participating in governance.

### Responsibilities {#responsibilities}

- Vote actively on governance proposals
- Provide rationale for their decisions
- Engage with the community and answer questions
- Comply with the Code of Conduct and avoid conflicts of interest

Delegates may receive **incentives** if they meet participation criteria such as maintaining 80%+ voting activity, regular updates, and holding at least 0.5% of veNEAR.

## Participants {#participants}

Anyone holding veNEAR can participate in governance directly — by voting, submitting proposals, or delegating their tokens.

Participants can:

- Self-delegate or choose a delegate
- Submit improvement proposals (grants, rules, experiments)
- Join discussions in public governance forums

House of Stake encourages both **direct** and **delegated** participation to ensure flexibility and inclusion.

[Endorsed Delegates](https://gov.near.org/t/announcing-the-initial-set-of-endorsed-delegates/40815?u=kv9990) are officially approved governance participants, selected by the Screening Committee through an open and competitive process. They represent veNEAR holders who choose to delegate their voting power for greater efficiency and coordination in protocol governance.

These delegates reflect a strong mix of experienced individuals and active NEAR-aligned teams, many of whom have contributed to the ecosystem for years.

## Role of Delegates {#role-of-delegates}

Participation in House of Stake is permissionless — anyone holding veNEAR can vote directly. However, the delegate system exists to streamline governance for everyday participants by enabling delegation to trusted representatives.

## Expectations & Standards {#expectations-standards}

Endorsed Delegates are expected to:

- Participate in at least 80% of all votes
- Publish public rationales for their decisions
- Provide quarterly updates on the governance forum
- Maintain independence from major conflicts of interest
- Follow the Code of Conduct

In return, they may be eligible for performance-based rewards. The Screening Committee will likely expand the delegate set over time, but the initial group was intentionally kept small to ensure focus and clarity in the early phase.
