# Screening Committee {#screening-committee}

The **Screening Committee** is a core governance body within House of Stake. It acts as the first layer of review and quality control for proposals, delegates, and broader governance processes — ensuring that only aligned, well-formed proposals reach the full voting body.

This group serves as a **filter** and **guardian of integrity**, maintaining a balance between efficiency and due diligence.

## Current Status: Interim Screening Committee {#current-status-interim-screening-committee}

To expedite the launch of House of Stake, the **NEAR Foundation** appointed an **Interim Screening Committee**. This temporary body was responsible for launching the delegate process and selecting the **first cohort of Endorsed Delegates**.

### Interim Committee Members {#interim-committee-members}

- Bianca Guimaraes-Chadwick (NEAR Foundation)
- Lane Rettig (NEAR Foundation)
- Bowen Wang (Near One)
- Gauntlet (1 seat)

The interim Committee will remain in place **only until** a formal Charter is proposed and approved through governance voting.

## What Happens Next {#what-happens-next}

The transition from a Foundation-appointed interim body to a **community-elected Screening Committee** is now the top priority.

### Timeline and Process {#timeline-and-process}

1. **Charter Proposal (target: mid-August)**
   The NEAR Foundation will publish a detailed _Screening Committee Charter_ proposal covering:
   - How members are elected, added, or removed
   - Term lengths and rotation
   - Committee responsibilities and accountability mechanisms
   - Committee size and composition
   - The election and replacement process

2. **Election Process**
   After the Charter is approved, elections will be held to form a **new, community-led Screening Committee**.

3. **Sunsetting the Interim Committee**
   The interim body will disband after the first election is complete. **Ensuring this transition** is the committee's highest and final responsibility.

## Community Input & Nominations {#community-input-nominations}

The process is open. If you:
