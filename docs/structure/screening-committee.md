# Screening Committee

The **Screening Committee** is a core governance body within House of Stake. It acts as the first layer of review and quality control for proposals, delegates, and broader governance processes â€” ensuring that only aligned, well-formed proposals reach the full voting body.

This group serves as a **filter** and **guardian of integrity**, maintaining a balance between efficiency and due diligence.

## Current Status: Interim Screening Committee

To expedite the launch of House of Stake, the **NEAR Foundation** appointed an **Interim Screening Committee**. This temporary body was responsible for launching the delegate process and selecting the **first cohort of Endorsed Delegates**.

### Interim Committee Members

- Bianca Guimaraes-Chadwick (NEAR Foundation)
- Lane Rettig (NEAR Foundation)
- Bowen Wang (Near One)
- Gauntlet (1 seat)

The interim Committee will remain in place **only until** a formal Charter is proposed and approved through governance voting.

## What Happens Next

The transition from a Foundation-appointed interim body to a **community-elected Screening Committee** is now the top priority.

### Timeline and Process

1. **Charter Proposal (target: mid-August)**
   The NEAR Foundation will publish a detailed _Screening Committee Charter_ proposal covering:
   - How members are elected, added, or removed
   - Term lengths and rotation
   - Committee responsibilities and accountability mechanisms
   - Committee size and composition
   - The election and replacement process

2. **Election Process**
   After the Charter is approved, elections will be held to form a **new, community-led Screening Committee**.

3. **Sunsetting the Interim Committee**
   The interim body will disband after the first election is complete. **Ensuring this transition** is the committee's highest and final responsibility.

## Community Input & Nominations

The process is open. If you:

Want to **nominate someone** (or yourself) to the future Screening Committee

Have ideas about **how the committee should be structured or elected**

ðŸ‘‰ Please share your thoughts in the [forum thread](https://gov.near.org/t/transitioning-the-screening-committee/41490).

This is not yet a formal application process â€” just a **head start** to surface early ideas and candidates.

## Responsibilities of the Screening Committee

### Proposal Review & Governance Flow

- **Pre-screen proposals** before community-wide voting
- **Filter mechanism**: proposals rejected by the Committee (less than 4 out of 7 votes) must achieve a 75% supermajority to pass

### Delegate Selection & Oversight

- **Initiate Calls for Delegates**
- **Select initial Endorsed Delegates**
- **Monitor delegate behavior and voting patterns**
- **Flag conflicts of interest or violations**

### Oversight & Improvement

- **Adjust veNEAR reward incentives** to remain competitive
- **Publish meeting notes and decisions** for transparency
- **Continuously improve frameworks** based on community feedback

### Future Transition

Eventually, as the system matures, the Screening Committee will **transfer the authority to select Endorsed Delegates**, enabling fully community-led governance.
