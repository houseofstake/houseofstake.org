# Responsibilities and Scope (RACI)

This section defines the roles and responsibilities of key governance participants within the House of Stake, using the [RACI matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix):

- **R – Responsible:** Who does the work
- **A – Accountable:** Who is ultimately answerable for the outcome
- **C – Consulted:** Who provides input or expertise
- **I – Informed:** Who must be kept up to date

## Example: Key Governance Processes

| Process                       | Screening Committee | Endorsed Delegates | Delegates | Security Council | veNEAR Holders |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Pre-screening grant proposals | R, A                |                    |           | C                | I              |
| Voting on proposals           |                     | R, A               | R, A      | I                | C, A           |
| Selecting new delegates       | R                   |                    |           | C                | I              |
| Removing bad actors           | R                   |                    |           | C                | I              |
| Emergency intervention        |                     |                    |           | R, A             | I              |
| Updating reward frameworks    | R, A                |                    |           | C                | I              |

## Why RACI Matters

The RACI model clarifies responsibilities, reduces overlap, and increases transparency. It makes complex governance processes easier to understand and more efficient—especially in decentralized environments.
