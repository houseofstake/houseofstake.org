# Responsibilities and Scope (RACI)


This section defines the roles and responsibilities of key governance participants within the House of Stake, using the [RACI matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix):

- **R – Responsible:** Who does the work
- **A – Accountable:** Who is ultimately answerable for the outcome
- **C – Consulted:** Who provides input or expertise
- **I – Informed:** Who must be kept up to date
