### 3.1 Agreed Behaviors

3.1.1 Act in good faith and perform due diligence before voting or advising.
<br/>3.1.2 Make your best effort to resolve disputes or issues privately or with a moderator instead of escalating to public channels.
<br/>3.1.3 Disclose conflicts of interest, according to the Conflict of Interest Policy.
<br/>3.1.4 Provide clear rationales for governance actions.
<br/>3.1.5 Communicate with respect, inclusivity, and professionalism.
<br/>3.1.6 Protect the privacy, dignity, and safety of community members.
<br/>3.1.7 Collaborate transparently; document decisions; support iterative improvement.

### 3.2 Prohibited Behaviors

3.2.1 Harassment, bullying, stalking, or identity-based abuse.
<br/>3.2.2 Plagiarism, falsification, or misrepresentation of work.
<br/>3.2.3 Vote-buying, bribery, or covert influence.
<br/>3.2.4 Failure to disclose conflicts of interest.
<br/>3.2.5 Doxxing, privacy violations, or unauthorized data exposure.
<br/>3.2.6 Spamming, shilling, brigading, disinformation, or sabotage.
<br/>3.2.7 Making unsubstantiated public accusations against any HoS participant, contributor, or program — including on external platforms (social media, podcasts, media, or other public forums) — without first seeking clarification or following reporting channels.

3.3 Good Practice Example

A delegate suspects irregularities in a funding decision. They first request clarification privately from the relevant working group, then file a report through the official HoS intake form with supporting evidence.

3.4 Bad Practice Example

A contributor tweets that a House of Stake program is “stealing funds” without evidence, instead of using reporting channels. The claim is later deleted, but reputational harm has already occurred.
