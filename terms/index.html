<ol start="5">
<li><strong>About the Interface</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Interface aggregates and presents publicly available and derived information related to staking activity and validator performance on the NEAR blockchain.</p>
<p>The Interface also provides methods through which the User may indicate staking-related actions they wish to perform via the House of Stake smart contracts, which are deployed on the NEAR blockchain. These methods enable the Interface to prepare draft transaction messages that the User can review and execute using a third-party NEAR-compatible wallet or device.</p>
<p>When used in this way, the Interface facilitates user-initiated interactions such as staking, unstaking, and reward claiming. These actions are executed solely through the User’s connected wallet and the House of Stake contracts. The Interface does not process or broadcast any transaction itself.</p>
<p>Separately, the Interface also surfaces historical and real-time data through integration with the Agora Indexer. This includes visualizations of staking flows, validator rewards, and other relevant protocol data. The Indexer is read-only and provides no capability to initiate or execute transactions.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>About the Middleware</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Middleware includes two distinct components:</p>
<p><strong>House of Stake Smart Contracts</strong> — A suite of smart contracts deployed on the NEAR blockchain that facilitate delegation, undelegation, and reward interactions between Users and NEAR validators. These contracts are open, permissionless, and can be accessed directly by any User via a compatible wallet or client.</p>
<p><strong>Agora Indexer</strong> — A dedicated component relying on one or more vendors to extract data from the NEAR blockchain and write records to a relational database that</p>
<p>The House of Stake contract layer operates independently and can be accessed without using the Interface. The Agora Indexer is fit-for-purpose and hosted only for consumption by the interface.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Interface relationship to Middleware</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Users are not required to use the Interface in order to interact with either the House of Stake smart contracts or the Agora Indexer, i.e. the Middleware. Anyone with a compatible wallet or API client can engage directly with the Middleware components or with the NEAR blockchain.</p>
<p>The Interface maintainers do not operate or control the NEAR blockchain, wallet software, validator infrastructure, or Middleware. They simply provide a user-friendly presentation of publicly available data and facilitate interaction with the House of Stake contracts through transaction message drafting.</p>
<p>On-chain data—including balances, delegation status, and transaction history—may also be accessed through NEAR-compatible block explorers and RPC endpoints. Off-chain data made available through the Agora Indexer is independently queryable and publicly documented.</p>
<p>By combining publicly available information with the User’s actions, the Interface may generate NEAR-compatible transaction messages intended for use with the House of Stake contracts. These messages are delivered to a compatible third-party wallet selected by the User after choosing to connect (e.g., via a “Connect Wallet” button).</p>
<p>All transaction messages must be reviewed and signed by the User. Signing requires the use of the User’s private key, which is never accessible to the Interface, its maintainers, or contributors. The Interface cannot initiate or broadcast transactions on behalf of the User.</p>
<p>Once authorized, the transaction may be submitted by the User’s wallet to the NEAR blockchain. Network fees may apply. Any changes in token balances or delegation status resulting from such transactions can later be queried through the Agora Indexer.</p>
<p>The Interface and its maintainers are not agents, custodians, or intermediaries. They do not hold, manage, or have access to any tokens, private keys, passwords, or other property of the User. All blockchain activity is executed solely through the User’s interactions with the NEAR network and the Middleware. The Interface maintainers do not collect any compensation from Users for the use of the Interface.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h1 id="non-custodial-wallet-connection"><strong>Non-Custodial Wallet Connection</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You must connect a NEAR-compatible self-custodied wallet to use the Interface. You are solely responsible for safeguarding wallet credentials.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2 id="token-lists-and-token-identification"><strong>Token Lists and Token Identification</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In providing information about tokens, the Interface associates or presumes the association of a token name, symbol, or logo with a specific smart contract deployed to one or more blockchain systems. In making such associations, the Interface relies upon third-party resources which may not be accurate or may not conform to a given User’s expectations. Multiple smart contracts can utilize the same token name or token symbol as one another, meaning that the name or symbol of a token does not guarantee that it is the token desired by the User or generally associated with such name or symbol. Users must not rely on the name, symbol, or branding of a token on the Interface, but instead must examine the specific smart contract associated with the name, symbol, or branding and confirm that the token accords with User’s expectations.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2 id="tax-issues"><strong>Tax Issues</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The tax consequences of purchasing, selling, holding, transferring, or locking tokens or otherwise utilizing the Middleware are uncertain and may vary by jurisdiction. Interface Maintainers have undertaken no due diligence or investigation into such tax consequences, and assume no obligation or liability to optimize, facilitate or bear the tax consequences to any person.</p>

<p>The Interface may display or link to third-party websites, APIs, analytics tools, or token issuers. We do not control and are not responsible for any third-party content, accuracy, or services. Your use of third-party resources is at your own risk and subject to their terms.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h2 id="cryptography-risks"><strong>Cryptography Risks</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to blockchain systems, or tokens, including the theft, loss, or inaccessibility thereof.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<h2 id="fork-handling"><strong>Fork Handling</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Middleware, and all tokens may be subject to Forks. Forks occur when some or all persons running the software clients for a particular blockchain system adopt a new client or a new version of an existing client that: (i) changes the protocol rules in backward-compatible or backward-incompatible manner that affects which transactions can be added into later blocks, how later blocks are added to the blockchain, or other matters relating to the future operation of the protocol; or (ii) reorganizes or changes past blocks to alter the history of the blockchain. Some forks are “contentious” and thus may result in two or more persistent alternative versions of the protocol or blockchain, either of which may be viewed as or claimed to be the legitimate or genuine continuation of the original.</p>
<p>Interface maintainers cannot anticipate, control or influence the occurrence or outcome of forks, and do not assume any risk, liability or obligation in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Interface maintainers do not assume any responsibility to notify a User of pending, threatened or completed forks. Interface maintainers will respond (or refrain from responding) to any forks in such manner as Interface maintainers determine in their sole and absolute discretion. Interface maintainers shall not have any duty or obligation, or liability to a User if such response (or lack of such response) acts to a User’s detriment. Each User assumes full responsibility to independently remain apprised of and informed about possible forks, and to manage the User’s own interests and risks in connection therewith.</p>

<h2 id="essential-third-party-software-dependencies"><strong>Essential Third-Party Software Dependencies</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Middleware and other relevant blockchain systems and smart contracts are public software utilities that are accessible directly through any compatible third-party node or indirectly through any compatible third-party “wallet” application that interacts with such a node. Interacting with the Middleware does not require the use of the Interface, but the Interface is only a convenient and user-friendly option of reading and displaying data from the Middleware and generating standard draft transaction messages compatible with the Middleware. The User may choose to interact with the Middleware using softwares other than the Interface. As the Interface does not provide wallet software applications or nodes for blockchain systems, such software constitutes an essential third-party software and user dependency without which the Middleware cannot be used and tokens cannot be traded or used. Furthermore, the Interface may use APIs and servers of Interface maintainers or third parties and there are no guarantees as to the continued operation, maintenance, availability, or security of any of the foregoing dependencies.</p>

You must consult your own professional advisers. The tax consequences of purchasing, selling, holding, transferring, or locking tokens or otherwise utilizing the Interface are uncertain and may vary by jurisdiction.
