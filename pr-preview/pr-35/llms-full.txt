## veNEAR Locking Mechanism

# veNEAR Locking Mechanism

To obtain **veNEAR**, users must lock **NEAR**, **stNEAR**, or **liNEAR** tokens in a vote-escrow contract.
The House of Stake governance system supports a **single flexible locking model** that does not require users to commit to a fixed duration.

---

### Locking Model

Users lock tokens without selecting a fixed period.
veNEAR **accumulates linearly over time**, up to a maximum equivalent of 4 years of lock.
Users can initiate an unlock at any time. Once they do, a **45 day cooldown** begins, during which **veNEAR voting power decays to zero**, and tokens become withdrawable at the end.

**Key properties:**

- No fixed period required
- veNEAR accrues gradually (max at 4 years)
- 45 day cooldown after initiating unlock
- Flexible exit at any time

---

### Example: veNEAR Accumulation and Unlock Flow

This mechanism rewards users who consistently keep tokens locked, while still offering the freedom to exit.

1. A user deposits 1 NEAR into the veNEAR contract.
2. veNEAR begins to accrue gradually (e.g., per epoch).
3. After 3 years, the user initiates an unlock.
4. A 45 day cooldown begins — veNEAR linearly decays to 0.
5. After the cooldown ends, the 1 NEAR becomes withdrawable.

_veNEAR premium and decay calculations for the locking mechanism_

---

The veNEAR system is built on **stake-weighted and time-based principles**, balancing flexibility with meaningful participation in governance.
It allows users to retain control over their assets while gradually earning influence within the NEAR ecosystem.
The locking model is designed to avoid rigid commitments, while still rewarding long-term alignment and engagement.

---

## Versioning & Evolution

# Versioning & Evolution

House of Stake is designed as an evolving governance system. To stay relevant, it must be able to improve over time — without losing stability or trust.

## On-chain Versioning

Each major governance change (new roles, voting rules, funding mechanisms) is treated as a version upgrade.
These changes are proposed and approved through the same proposal and voting process.

- All version changes are tracked on-chain
- Each version is publicly documented
- Participants can review historical changes and rationale

## Why Versioning Matters

- Promotes transparency and continuity
- Prevents abrupt, undocumented changes
- Creates shared memory for governance evolution

## Community-Driven Iteration

Governance is never "final."
The House of Stake framework is open to experimentation, improvements, and new ideas — as long as they are proposed, reviewed, and voted on transparently.

---

## What is veNEAR

# What is veNEAR

**veNEAR (vote-escrowed NEAR)** is a governance token that allows NEAR holders to participate in House of Stake governance through a stake-weighted, time-locked mechanism.

By locking NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR tokens, users receive veNEAR. The longer the lock duration, the greater the voting power received. This aligns incentives for long-term commitment and active participation.

![veNEAR Flow](assets/venear-flow.png)

## Key Characteristics

- **Non-transferable**: veNEAR cannot be transferred or traded.
- **Time-weighted voting power**: Voting power increases with the duration of the lock — no minimum or maximum period required.
- **Multi-asset support**: Users can lock NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR to receive veNEAR.

## Purpose of veNEAR

- Aligning stakeholders over the long-term to influence the direction of NEAR governance.
- Provide a clear and predictable incentive structure via reward distribution.
- Encourage thoughtful participation and discourage manipulation.

## Why It Matters

veNEAR creates strong alignment between governance power and economic commitment. Those who lock assets for longer periods gain more influence, encouraging responsible, engaged decision-making that supports the long-term health of the NEAR ecosystem.

---

## Governance Philosophy

# Governance Philosophy

The philosophy behind House of Stake is rooted in three principles:

1. **Stake-based legitimacy** — Those with more skin in the game should have more influence. Governance decisions should reflect the interests of long-term ecosystem participants who are economically and reputationally invested in NEAR.

2. **Transparency and accountability** — All governance actions must be traceable, documented, and open to review. Proposals, votes, and delegate activity are recorded on-chain and made publicly accessible.

3. **Efficiency without centralization** — Governance should be fast and effective — without becoming centralized. Pre-screening, delegate specialization, and clear processes help reduce noise while preserving decentralization.

This philosophy is a direct response to the shortcomings of earlier models like the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC), where equal voting rights led to low participation and diluted accountability.

House of Stake aims to strike a balance between **economic alignment**, **open participation**, and **pragmatic execution**, ensuring governance is both meaningful and manageable.

## NEAR House of Stake - Interim Constitution (v0.1.0)

# NEAR House of Stake - Interim Constitution (v0.1.0)

---

## Article 1 — Foundational Provisions

**1.1. Purpose**  
The NEAR House of Stake ("HoS") is the stake-weighted governance system of NEAR that exists to preserve neutrality, legitimacy, and resilience by enabling meaningful, stake-aligned participation.

**1.2. Binding Effect**  
Rules may be enforced onchain or off-chain; all rules adopted under this Constitution are binding.

**1.3. Supremacy**  
This Constitution is the supreme governance document for NEAR House of Stake - the decentralized network of veNEAR tokenholders. In the event of conflict with any policy, charter, or guideline, this Constitution supersedes their controls unless amended under Article 9. *(Referring to DAO ratified policy & charters, excludes NEAR House of Stake Foundation bylaws.)*

---

## Article 2 — Mandate

### 2.1 Economic Governance

**2.1.1.** Treasury management  
**2.1.2.** Programs to support economic sustainability  
**2.1.3.** Economic parameters:
- **2.1.3.1.** Inflation
- **2.1.3.2.** Fee switch for AI products, intents, etc.

### 2.2 Technical Governance

**2.2.1.** Incremental, narrow scope to begin  
**2.2.2.** e.g., MPC signers for chain signatures  
**2.2.3.** Determine which NEAR Enhancement Proposals (NEPs) should be escalated to HoS  
**2.2.4.** Anything that can't be governed on GitHub

### 2.3 Build Legitimacy

**2.3.1.** Maximize the amount of NEAR/veNEAR in the system  
**2.3.2.** Participation by broad subset of the community  
**2.3.3.** Decentralise Screening Committee  
**2.3.4.** Put in place policy: mission, vision, values, constitution, charters, policy, co-creation cycles

### 2.4 Grow Engagement and Ecosystem Health

**2.4.1.** In the DAO, in governance, in the protocol, in NEAR ecosystem more broadly  
**2.4.2.** Decentralized stakeholders participate in governance

### 2.5 Anti-Mandates

The following are **explicit anti-mandates**, i.e., things to avoid:

**2.5.1.** Grants for the sake of grants. House of Stake won't have an official "grants program" for now, and there won't be a free-for-all for funding requests. Proposals that target the above mandate items may, of course, include requests for funding for specific uses.

**2.5.2.** Full technical governance of the NEAR protocol, or of other products including Chain Signatures, NEAR Intents, and NEAR AI. These products are all extraordinarily complex and House of Stake doesn't have the necessary technical expertise, and isn't well positioned, to own this anytime soon. We'll start with less complex technical governance tasks, such as the one outlined above: governing the Chain Signatures MPC signer set, and build capacity to take on more technical governance in the future.

## What is House of Stake

# What is House of Stake

The **House of Stake (HoS)** is a governance framework designed to empower NEAR token holders through a transparent, efficient, and stake-weighted decision-making system.

Instead of a one-person-one-vote model, HoS introduces a more sustainable and long-term approach based on **veNEAR** — a vote-escrowed token that rewards long-term commitment and alignment.

HoS was created to address common challenges in decentralized governance, such as low engagement, lack of transparency, and misaligned incentives.

Key components include:

- **Stake-weighted voting** via veNEAR
- **Pre-screening of proposals** by a Screening Committee
- A **delegate system** with clear roles and aligned incentives
- **Structured funding** sourced from 0.5% protocol inflation
- **On-chain voting** and transparent processes

The vision of HoS is to build a sustainable, decentralized, and user-owned governance system that can evolve alongside the needs of the NEAR ecosystem.

This documentation explains how House of Stake works, how to get involved, and how it will help shape the future of NEAR governance.

## AI Governance Product Roadmap

# AI Governance Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the current direction of **AI Governance** within **House of Stake**, based on the document [AI Governance Product Roadmap](https://gov.near.org/t/ai-governance-product-roadmap/41683).

It describes three key phases in the evolution of AI-driven governance — **Support, Represent, Organize** — each corresponding to a core product: **Proposal Dashboard**, **Delegate Agent**, and **Manager Agent**.

---

### **Phase 1: Support — Proposal Dashboard**

The first phase focuses on enhancing human participation in governance.
**Proposal Dashboard** is an intelligent platform that helps authors, reviewers, and the community work with proposals more effectively and transparently.

AI capabilities include:
- Evaluating and summarizing proposals based on clarity, completeness, and mission alignment;
- Helping authors refine structure, reasoning, and relevance;
- Supporting reviewers by identifying risks, gaps, and promising ideas.

At this stage, AI acts as a **co-pilot for governance** — augmenting human decision-making rather than replacing it.

---

### **Phase 2: Represent — Delegate Agent**

The second phase introduces **representation through autonomous, customizable AI agents**.
**Delegate Agent** is a transparent AI delegate that participates in voting, informed by Proposal Dashboard evaluations and user-defined principles.

It enables:
- Automated yet auditable participation in governance processes;
- Transparent reasoning and traceable decision logic;
- Personalization and adaptive learning through user feedback.

This phase makes governance **scalable and accessible**, allowing every participant to be represented — even without direct, constant involvement.

---

### **Phase 3: Organize — Manager Agent**

The final phase focuses on **coordination and organizational management** within DAOs.
**Manager Agent** can manage committee membership, roles, and responsibilities in real time, based on objective and transparent criteria.

It enables DAOs to:
- Automate role and membership management;
- Prevent capture and improve accountability;
- Scale through flexible, autonomous decision-making groups.

Here, AI agents don’t replace human judgment — they help determine **who decides and how**, enabling a dynamic, self-organizing governance model.

---

### **Conclusion**

This roadmap defines a pathway for integrating AI into decentralized governance — from support and analysis to autonomous coordination.
**House of Stake** views artificial intelligence as a means to **enhance human participation and transparency**, building the foundation for governance that grows with the ecosystem and its collective values.

## Why This Matters

# Why This Matters

Governance is infrastructure.
Without reliable and transparent decision-making, even the best technology and ecosystems can fail.

House of Stake was created in response to the challenges observed in earlier governance efforts — especially around low engagement, slow processes, and poor incentive alignment.

## Key Problems It Aims to Solve

- **Lack of participation:** One-person-one-vote models often result in voter apathy
- **Inefficient execution:** Unclear roles and open-ended debates stall progress
- **Misaligned incentives:** Participants have little reason to stay active or long-term committed
- **Opaque decisions:** Important calls happen off-chain and without community oversight

## Why Stake-Weighted Governance?

Stake-weighted systems, like those powered by veNEAR, align influence with long-term commitment.
They help ensure that governance is shaped by those with meaningful investment in the network's future — not just short-term incentives.

House of Stake isn’t perfect — but it’s a step toward governance that is sustainable, open, and focused on outcomes.

## Delegates & Participants

# Delegates & Participants

In House of Stake, **delegates** play a central role in executing governance on behalf of veNEAR holders. They are trusted participants who vote on proposals, help shape the future of the ecosystem, and are expected to act transparently and responsibly.

## Delegates

Delegates receive voting power when other veNEAR holders delegate their tokens to them. To become a delegate, a user must meet certain requirements and publicly commit to participating in governance.

### Responsibilities

- Vote actively on governance proposals
- Provide rationale for their decisions
- Engage with the community and answer questions
- Comply with the Code of Conduct and avoid conflicts of interest

Delegates may receive **incentives** if they meet participation criteria such as maintaining 80%+ voting activity, regular updates, and holding at least 0.5% of veNEAR.

## Participants

Anyone holding veNEAR can participate in governance directly — by voting, submitting proposals, or delegating their tokens.

Participants can:

- Self-delegate or choose a delegate
- Submit improvement proposals (grants, rules, experiments)
- Join discussions in public governance forums

House of Stake encourages both **direct** and **delegated** participation to ensure flexibility and inclusion.

[Endorsed Delegates](https://gov.near.org/t/announcing-the-initial-set-of-endorsed-delegates/40815?u=kv9990) are officially approved governance participants, selected by the Screening Committee through an open and competitive process. They represent veNEAR holders who choose to delegate their voting power for greater efficiency and coordination in protocol governance.

---

These delegates reflect a strong mix of experienced individuals and active NEAR-aligned teams, many of whom have contributed to the ecosystem for years.

## Role of Delegates

Participation in House of Stake is permissionless — anyone holding veNEAR can vote directly. However, the delegate system exists to streamline governance for everyday participants by enabling delegation to trusted representatives.

## Expectations & Standards

Endorsed Delegates are expected to:

- Participate in at least 80% of all votes
- Publish public rationales for their decisions
- Provide quarterly updates on the governance forum
- Maintain independence from major conflicts of interest
- Follow the Code of Conduct

In return, they may be eligible for performance-based rewards. The Screening Committee will likely expand the delegate set over time, but the initial group was intentionally kept small to ensure focus and clarity in the early phase.

      1. submit and vote on GPs under the respective GP Process. 

      2. raise and vote on concerns about a delegate or a delegate’s actions that have harmed the community;

      3. approve any other action as may be set forth in the House of Stake Proposals and  Voting Procedures, the Foundation Articles and these Bylaws.

      such Foundation Director(s) may reject execution steps for such GP and/or take such other steps as are required to reject such GP. 

5. **Hierarchy** 

   1. To the extent there is ever a conflict between the provisions of the Bylaws and the  Foundation Articles, the Foundation Articles shall prevail.

6. **Amendments**

   1. Amendments to these Bylaws may be proposed and ratified by the Tokenholders by Tokenholder Vote (with effect from the adoption thereof in accordance with the House of Stake Proposals and Voting Procedures). The amendment proposal should be clearly drafted to reflect the changes to the existing Bylaws, including the specific sections or articles to be amended, the reasons for the amendment, and the proposed new text.

7. **Dispute Resolution** 

   1. Should a controversy, dispute or claim arise out of or in relation to these Bylaws  ("Dispute"), the Foundation, the Directors, the Supervisor or the Tokenholders (as  appropriate) must give 30 days' notice of such Dispute to the relevant party/ies (the "Notice  of Dispute"). Should the Dispute not be resolved at the expiration of 30 days after service  of the Notice of Dispute, the relevant party may commence arbitration proceedings in  accordance with (b) below. In any dispute involving the actions of the Foundation Directors  or the Supervisor, the Foundation, and not the Foundation Directors or Supervisor, shall  be party to the arbitration proceedings. 

   2. Should the Dispute remain at the expiration of 30 days after service of the Notice  of Dispute, the Dispute shall be settled by arbitration administered by the International  Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules (the  "Rules"). The arbitration shall be seated in George Town, Grand Cayman and governed  by Cayman Islands law. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitration  shall be determined by a sole arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the Rules. Any  award or decision made by the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be final and binding  on the parties without any right of appeal, and judgment upon any award thus obtained  may be entered in or enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

## Introducing NEAR House of Stake: A New Era of Governance

## **NEAR House of Stake is Live on Mainnet**

Today, the NEAR Protocol enters a new chapter in its evolution. We're proud to announce the mainnet launch of [**House of Stake**](https://gov.houseofstake.org/): a next-generation governance system designed to be transparent, scalable, and adaptive. More than just a tool, it's the first step in a multi-phase transformation of how NEAR is governed—and, eventually, how governance itself is reimagined.

{/* truncate */}

**Phase one**, now underway, is about bootstrapping: building foundational infrastructure, establishing legitimacy, and delivering a functional and accountable system of stake-weighted governance. It’s a pragmatic design, relying on delegated voting and token lockups to ensure long-term alignment: all participants must lock $NEAR, and the longer they lock, the more voting power they receive.

In **phase two**, House of Stake will take on broader responsibilities across the NEAR ecosystem, starting with improving protocol economics. In **phase three**, AI becomes a first-class participant in governance—supporting decision-making, managing workflows, and eventually unlocking new models like “swarm governance,” where intelligent agents can represent the preferences of thousands of stakeholders at once.

This is the foundation for **a new kind of institution**—one that can scale with the network, adapt to its needs, and bring democratic ideals into programmable systems.

### **Why House of Stake?**

Two years ago, NEAR’s previous experiment in on-chain governance—the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC)—pushed the boundaries of community-led funding and participation. But it also faced challenges common to a lot of DAOs: low voter turnout, poor incentive design, and limited alignment between stakeholder capital and influence.

House of Stake is a novel experiment in on-chain governance that incorporates lessons from NDC and other, previous governance experiments. It replaces “one person, one vote” with a flexible, token-locked voting mechanism called **veNEAR** (vote-escrowed NEAR), which strengthens governance influence based on time-locked commitment. Proposals are screened for alignment and quality before going to a vote, and incentives are structured to encourage participation.

This system is designed not only to work—but to evolve. To guide that evolution, we’re actively tracking how it performs—beyond just on-chain metrics.

**What does success look like?**

- Consistently high delegate participation and proposal engagement

- Quality and clarity of proposals passing the screening process

- Diverse stakeholder representation (not just whales)

- Growing trust in the process, measured through surveys and forum feedback

- Effective use of incentives: are rewards driving real contribution or just farming?

### **What We Shipped**

Over the past year, we’ve worked with the best partner teams in the world to design and ship the House of Stake system. Based on governance [research and design](https://www.gauntlet.xyz/resources/near-house-of-stake-governance-proposal) from our friends at [Gauntlet](https://www.gauntlet.xyz/), built by our friends at [FastNear](https://fastnear.com/) and [Agora](https://agora.xyz/), and with facilitation, integration and product expertise from our friends at [Hack Humanity](https://www.hackhumanity.com/). House of Stake already [live on mainnet](https://gov.houseofstake.org/):

- **veNEAR Governance Token**: Users lock NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR to receive veNEAR. The longer the lock, the greater the voting power and rewards. This is a pragmatic approach: stake-weighted governance isn’t perfect but it’s currently the most effective Sybil resistance mechanism available. Our ambition is to evolve toward more democratic and identity-aware models as the technology matures.

- **Delegation System**: A curated group of [**Endorsed Delegates**](https://gov.near.org/t/announcing-the-initial-set-of-endorsed-delegates/40815) help scale decision-making. They’re required to maintain high participation rates, disclose their rationale, and act in line with the community’s goals.

- **Screening Committee and Security Council**: These oversight bodies ensure that governance is safe, credible, and efficient. The Screening Committee reviews proposals before they go to a vote; the Security Council has a final veto and can act quickly in emergencies.

- **On-chain Voting \+ Incentives**: Using NEAR’s 0.5% annual token inflation, as well as future protocol-generated revenue sources (intents, AI infrastructure, etc.), the system funds veNEAR holders, active delegates, and community-approved grant proposals—creating a sustainable, protocol-native governance economy.

### **Beyond Token Voting**

House of Stake was designed from day one to grow into a more expansive system. Here’s a high-level look at what comes next:

**Phase One (Now)**:

- Launch veNEAR and the on-chain voting system

- Community elects the screening committee and begins proposal screening

- Distribute early incentives and test mechanisms

- Ship foundational infrastructure (contracts, frontend, onboarding, documentation)

**Phase Two**:

- House of Stake expands its scope: funding more verticals, coordinating more protocol functions

- Begins to own protocol economics and budgetary governance

- Introduces more robust delegate frameworks, forum tooling, and working groups

- Runs on-chain experiments in public goods allocation and participatory budgeting

**Phase Three:**

- Deep AI integration: agents that help interpret, vote on, and even propose governance actions

- Agents are trained on user values and community norms: governance copilots and autonomous delegates

- Governance agents represent thousands of users' preferences, run simulations of policy outcomes, and automatically adjust decisions based on community sentiment

- “Swarm governance”: a network of AI actors collaborating on behalf of their human stakeholders, coordinating at scales humans can’t match

- Real-world lessons exported to cooperatives, civic networks, and other governance domains

The House of Stake roadmap goes far beyond features. We’re adopting cutting-edge technologies and working at the fringes of what’s possible, and we’ll share the tools we build and the things we learn with the wider world.

### **Why It Matters**

Blockchains today face a dual legitimacy crisis. On-chain governance often devolves into plutocracy, while off-chain democratic systems are overwhelmed by misinformation and apathy. House of Stake takes both problems seriously and attempts to do something that’s never been done before.

By combining **transparent incentives, structured participation, and AI-augmented tooling**, House of Stake is setting a precedent for governance that works—not just for NEAR, but as a blueprint for the next generation of global, digital institutions.

And we’re doing it in the open, together, with community participation as both a mechanism and a goal.

### **How to Get Involved**

Participation is permissionless, and getting started is easy:

- **Lock NEAR into veNEAR** to gain governance power at [gov.houseofstake.org](http://gov.houseofstake.org)

- **Read and comment on proposals** on [gov.near.org](https://gov.near.org/)

- **Join the discussion** on [Telegram](https://t.me/NEAR_HouseOfStake)

- **Follow progress** via [@NEARGovernance](https://x.com/NEARGovernance)

- **Become a [delegate](https://gov.houseofstake.org/delegates?filter=endorsed)** by convincing others to delegate their veNEAR to you, or delegate to yourself and simply vote on proposals you care about

Whether you’re a validator, a developer, a researcher, or a curious community member, there’s a seat for you in the House. The time to act is now\! The foundations are still being laid, and early participation gives you more than voting power, it gives you influence over the very shape of this system.

Join the network. Read the proposals. Ask questions. Propose ideas. Help House of Stake lead a real on-chain governance revolution. If we succeed, NEAR won’t just be the “blockchain for AI.” It’ll be a proving ground for better institutions everywhere.

## Stanford OpenLab Partners With NEAR House of Stake on AI Governance Research

*Stanford OpenLab x NEAR House of Stake*

NEAR House of Stake and Stanford OpenLab are collaborating on a joint research initiative to explore the potential effects of AI on the governance of decentralized organizations. This work bridges OpenLab's multidisciplinary research into decentralized systems with House of Stake's real-world experimentation around AI-native governance, creating a shared environment to study, prototype, and publish on new governance mechanisms powered by intelligent agents.

This partnership marks an important step forward in understanding how AI may be able to support transparent, scalable, and privacy-preserving decision-making across not only DAOs but digital communities and 21st-century organizations at large.

{/* truncate */}

## Stanford OpenLab: A Multidisciplinary Initiative Committed to Open Systems

[OpenLab](https://openlab.stanford.edu/) is Stanford's meta-disciplinary research lab where engineers, artists, and theorists collaborate to prototype open, privacy-preserving, and human-centered technologies. Built at the intersection of engineering, law, economics, art, and the social sciences, OpenLab explores how decentralized systems can enhance trust, autonomy, and value exchange across digital, financial, and socio-technical networks. OpenLab works with several departments across the university, and is formally housed in the Management Sciences and Engineering department under Faculty Director Dr. Ashish Goel.

OpenLab's DAO Governance group in particular draws on economics, law, computer science, and business to engage in both theoretical research and practical pilots, with the ultimate goal of conceptualizing, prototyping, and evaluating new governance mechanisms.

> "AI is reshaping how communities coordinate and govern. Working with NEAR House of Stake will allow us study how these intelligent systems behave in the real world. Together, Stanford OpenLab and the NEAR ecosystem will be prototyping the technologies that could define the next generation of decentralized AI governance."

> –Reuben Youngblom, Program & Tech Lead at Stanford OpenLab

## NEAR House of Stake: The Real-World Testbed for AI-Driven Governance

Launched in 2020, [NEAR](https://www.near.org/) is the blockchain built to deliver on the full promise of the open, user-owned web. NEAR was originally built by AI and machine learning researchers who envisioned blockchain technology as the natural settlement infrastructure for AI micropayments. Today, NEAR powers Intents, the market-leading infrastructure for cross-chain swaps, as well as a full suite of privacy-preserving AI products. NEAR remains committed to the idea of a user-owned internet without walled gardens and corporate control. This long-term commitment aligns closely with OpenLab's mission to build open, interoperable, and human-centered digital systems.

[House of Stake](https://houseofstake.org/) is NEAR Protocol's governance hub and one of the first-ever DAOs to integrate AI directly into governance workflows. House of Stake is actively developing verifiable AI delegates to scale voter participation and rapidly allocate resources to the most impactful products and tooling across the ecosystem.

This makes House of Stake a valuable live environment where research-ready experiments can be run in the wild, not just in the lab. From agent-assisted voting to AI guardians that can detect anomalies across wallet behavior, House of Stake and its AI initiatives provide the ideal user environment for rigorous governance research.

## What This Collaboration Will Explore

The joint research will focus on several core questions at the intersection of AI and decentralized governance:

- **AI as a governance primitive.** What roles might AI agents play in interpreting proposals, modeling trade-offs, and summarizing complex decisions for stakeholders?
- **Verifiable AI systems.** Can blockchain-based verification ensure that AI agents act transparently and within defined constraints?
- **Privacy-preserving AI.** Can confidential inference ensure that AI agents participate in governance without exposing sensitive data or compromising user privacy?
- **Incentive-aligned delegation.** Can agent-assisted delegation reduce voter fatigue, improve representation, and strengthen the legitimacy of governance outcomes?
- **Human-in-the-loop mechanisms.** What design patterns might preserve human oversight while simultaneously benefiting from automated analysis, simulation, and recommendation?

These questions will be explored through a combination of formal research, computational modeling, and applied prototyping within House of Stake. The collaboration will leverage House of Stake as an experimentation environment where hypotheses can be tested, refined, and deployed. Any prototypes or governance mechanisms developed through the research partnership will be proposed directly to House of Stake for evaluation by the community.

## What's Next

Stanford OpenLab and NEAR House of Stake are beginning joint research this winter. Findings will be open-sourced and shared publicly to support the broader ecosystem of researchers, builders, and policymakers working on AI governance. The goal is to advance not just theoretical understanding but practical, implementable models for how AI-assisted governance can work safely and effectively at scale.

If you are interested in contributing to this research, please reach out through the [House of Stake Governance Forum](https://gov.near.org/) or to Stanford OpenLab's Program & Tech Lead Reuben Youngblom at [ryoungbl@stanford.edu](mailto:ryoungbl@stanford.edu).

## House of Stake Rewards Live: Lock NEAR, Receive Governance Rewards

# House of Stake Rewards Live: Lock NEAR, Receive Governance Rewards

With the passage of HSP-003 (veNEAR lockup incentives), we have prepared and are now implementing a substantial early adopter rewards rate.

For the first month, early participants locking NEAR or compatible LSTs will receive participation rewards that may be higher than standard staking returns, depending on participation and program parameters.

{/* truncate */}

## What is veNEAR?

veNEAR is a voting token you receive for locking your NEAR in the House of Stake protocol. When you lock NEAR, you receive veNEAR, which grants you:

- **Governance rewards** — in addition to standard protocol-level staking rewards, varying based on participation and program parameters
- **Real governance power** over House of Stake decisions
- **Direct alignment** with NEAR's long-term success

## How Locking Works

When you first enable House of Stake using your NEAR account, the veNEAR contract deploys a sub-account on your behalf. This `.venear.dao` account can accept your transferred NEAR (and transfer out locked NEAR), lock your NEAR, and stake NEAR that the account's contract has locked. The NEAR locked to this sub-account directly provides veNEAR to your main account, and that veNEAR grows over time—see previous announcements and the [original proposal](https://www.gauntlet.xyz/resources/near-house-of-stake-governance-proposal) for more details.

## Claiming Your Rewards

Every two weeks marks a "reward campaign period" for veNEAR. At the end of each two weeks you receive rewards proportional to the amount of NEAR locked (adjusted to however long within that period you had it locked for, assuming it wasn't already locked when the campaign period began).

You don't have to claim your rewards at each two week mark—they'll still be available to you at the end of the next claim period—but they do not automatically distribute to your account. When claimed, veNEAR rewards distribute NEAR to the veNEAR lockup contract corresponding to your main account. You can then transfer that NEAR out of the subaccount, or lock it to receive more veNEAR.

## How Large are My Rewards?

For this first month, veNEAR rewards are modeled to be materially higher than standard staking returns (reaching approximately ~7.5% annualized), depending on participation and program parameters. Your veNEAR subaccount can also stake locked tokens, meaning that locking up your NEAR during this time can generate materially higher participation incentives than staking alone, depending on program parameters!

## The Launch Window

This initial rewards rate will only last this first month, and will likely be adjusted down for the months after. Early participation means joining from the beginning of the program's active reward period.

## Your Seat at the Table

House of Stake isn't just about rewards, though: it's the foundation for a new era of NEAR governance.

The protocols that thrive long-term are the ones shaped by committed participants, not passive holders or short-term speculators. veNEAR puts real decision-making power in the hands of people with skin in the game. By locking now, you're not just receiving governance rewards, but claiming your voice in how NEAR evolves.

This is your opportunity to help shape the future of one of the most technically ambitious ecosystems in the entire crypto space. The decisions made in House of Stake governance will eventually influence protocol development, ecosystem funding, and the strategic direction of NEAR itself; but we can't get there without your support and participation!

## Get Started

Lock your NEAR now at [gov.houseofstake.org](https://gov.houseofstake.org).

Come build with us!

## NEAR Welcomes Angela Kreitenweis as Head of Governance at House of Stake

*Advancing community-driven decision-making as House of Stake goes live on mainnet and [NEAR governance enters its next phase](https://www.near.org/blog/near-house-of-stake-is-now-live-on-mainnet).*

Today, NEAR is pleased to announce that Angela Kreitenweis is joining as House of Stake Head of Governance. Angela will steward NEAR's governance evolution at a pivotal moment: [**House of Stake (HoS)**](https://www.near.org/blog/near-house-of-stake-is-now-live-on-mainnet), NEAR's next-generation stake-based governance system, has launched on mainnet, introducing veNEAR voting power and aligning long-term participation with meaningful voice in ecosystem decisions.

{/* truncate */}

Angela brings a rare combination of startup agility, systems design expertise, and deep governance insight to NEAR.

Her perspective is grounded in real-world experience. As she explains:

> Finding product-market fit is a hard challenge, and we have yet to prove that DAOs are a superior model for doing so. But if we want to test that premise properly, we must make DAOs not just more democratic, but more effective.

For Angela, decentralized governance is not only about making decisions together. It's about making *good* decisions. Every governance action should be evaluated against NEAR's North Star:

> Is this the best action we can take, in our collective capacity, for NEAR to become **the** blockchain for AI?

Her vision for the House of Stake is decentralized coordination that serves the protocol, not itself, driven by product success, pursuit of product-market fit, and measurable achievement. Governance must create **impact**, not inertia.

## Role & Mission

In her capacity as Head of Governance, Angela will carry the explicit mission of making House of Stake fully autonomous, anchoring [HoS's key mandates](https://gov.near.org/t/house-of-stake-mandate/41652) and steering its journey through the phases of decentralization.

**Key mandates for House of Stake:**

- **Economic governance:** Treasury management, economic sustainability, and fee switches for AI products, intents, and more.
- **Technical governance:** Managing signers for chain signatures and governance matters outside standard GitHub-based processes.
- **Legitimacy:** Increasing the amount of NEAR/veNEAR locked in the system and driving broad participation.
- **Engagement and ecosystem health:** Fostering stakeholder involvement in governance, the protocol, and the broader NEAR ecosystem.

Under Angela's leadership, the mission is clear: to make HoS not just functional, but exemplary. Her role bridges strategy and execution, building the frameworks of autonomy while ensuring the transition remains rigorous, inclusive, and aligned with NEAR's long-term goals. She will help shape governance that is resilient, adaptive, and rooted in NEAR's vision for an open AI economy where AI serves people, not platforms.

## What's Next

The launch of House of Stake marks the beginning of a new chapter in NEAR governance. Over the coming months, Angela will help ensure that participation becomes increasingly accessible and meaningful. Governance is open to all NEAR stakeholders, whether they build the core protocol, launch agentic AI, validate the chain, or use products running on NEAR. This is a process of co-creation that strengthens the entire ecosystem.

> We're building governance not just for NEAR, but with NEAR. Every voice, every vote, every proposal is part of making this ecosystem stronger.
> — Angela Kreitenweis
