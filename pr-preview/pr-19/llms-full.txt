## veNEAR Locking Mechanism

# veNEAR Locking Mechanism

To obtain **veNEAR**, users must lock **NEAR**, **stNEAR**, or **liNEAR** tokens in a vote-escrow contract.
The House of Stake governance system supports a **single flexible locking model** that does not require users to commit to a fixed duration.

---

### Locking Model

Users lock tokens without selecting a fixed period.
veNEAR **accumulates linearly over time**, up to a maximum equivalent of 4 years of lock.
Users can initiate an unlock at any time. Once they do, a **3-month cooldown** begins, during which **veNEAR voting power decays to zero**, and tokens become withdrawable at the end.

**Key properties:**

- No fixed period required
- veNEAR accrues gradually (max at 4 years)
- 3-month cooldown after initiating unlock
- Flexible exit at any time

---

### Example: veNEAR Accumulation and Unlock Flow

This mechanism rewards users who consistently keep tokens locked, while still offering the freedom to exit.

1. A user deposits 1 NEAR into the veNEAR contract.
2. veNEAR begins to accrue gradually (e.g., per epoch).
3. After 3 years, the user initiates an unlock.
4. A 3-month cooldown begins — veNEAR linearly decays to 0.
5. After the cooldown ends, the 1 NEAR becomes withdrawable.

_veNEAR premium and decay calculations for the locking mechanism_

---

The veNEAR system is built on **stake-weighted and time-based principles**, balancing flexibility with meaningful participation in governance.
It allows users to retain control over their assets while gradually earning influence within the NEAR ecosystem.
The locking model is designed to avoid rigid commitments, while still rewarding long-term alignment and engagement.

---

## Versioning & Evolution

# Versioning & Evolution

House of Stake is designed as an evolving governance system. To stay relevant, it must be able to improve over time — without losing stability or trust.

## On-chain Versioning

Each major governance change (new roles, voting rules, funding mechanisms) is treated as a version upgrade.
These changes are proposed and approved through the same proposal and voting process.

- All version changes are tracked on-chain
- Each version is publicly documented
- Participants can review historical changes and rationale

## Why Versioning Matters

- Promotes transparency and continuity
- Prevents abrupt, undocumented changes
- Creates shared memory for governance evolution

## Community-Driven Iteration

Governance is never "final."
The House of Stake framework is open to experimentation, improvements, and new ideas — as long as they are proposed, reviewed, and voted on transparently.

---

## What is veNEAR

# What is veNEAR

**veNEAR (vote-escrowed NEAR)** is a governance token that allows NEAR holders to participate in House of Stake governance through a stake-weighted, time-locked mechanism.

By locking NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR tokens, users receive veNEAR. The longer the lock duration, the greater the voting power received. This aligns incentives for long-term commitment and active participation.

![veNEAR Flow](assets/venear-flow.png)

## Key Characteristics

- **Non-transferable**: veNEAR cannot be transferred or traded.
- **Time-weighted voting power**: Voting power increases with the duration of the lock — no minimum or maximum period required.
- **Multi-asset support**: Users can lock NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR to receive veNEAR.

## Purpose of veNEAR

- Aligning stakeholders over the long-term to influence the direction of NEAR governance.
- Provide a clear and predictable incentive structure via reward distribution.
- Encourage thoughtful participation and discourage manipulation.

## Why It Matters

veNEAR creates strong alignment between governance power and economic commitment. Those who lock assets for longer periods gain more influence, encouraging responsible, engaged decision-making that supports the long-term health of the NEAR ecosystem.

---

## Governance Philosophy

# Governance Philosophy

The philosophy behind House of Stake is rooted in three principles:

1. **Stake-based legitimacy** — Those with more skin in the game should have more influence. Governance decisions should reflect the interests of long-term ecosystem participants who are economically and reputationally invested in NEAR.

2. **Transparency and accountability** — All governance actions must be traceable, documented, and open to review. Proposals, votes, and delegate activity are recorded on-chain and made publicly accessible.

3. **Efficiency without centralization** — Governance should be fast and effective — without becoming centralized. Pre-screening, delegate specialization, and clear processes help reduce noise while preserving decentralization.

This philosophy is a direct response to the shortcomings of earlier models like the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC), where equal voting rights led to low participation and diluted accountability.

House of Stake aims to strike a balance between **economic alignment**, **open participation**, and **pragmatic execution**, ensuring governance is both meaningful and manageable.

## What is House of Stake

# What is House of Stake

The **House of Stake (HoS)** is a governance framework designed to empower NEAR token holders through a transparent, efficient, and stake-weighted decision-making system.

Instead of a one-person-one-vote model, HoS introduces a more sustainable and long-term approach based on **veNEAR** — a vote-escrowed token that rewards long-term commitment and alignment.

HoS was created to address common challenges in decentralized governance, such as low engagement, lack of transparency, and misaligned incentives.

Key components include:

- **Stake-weighted voting** via veNEAR
- **Pre-screening of proposals** by a Screening Committee
- A **delegate system** with clear roles and aligned incentives
- **Structured funding** sourced from 0.5% protocol inflation
- **On-chain voting** and transparent processes

The vision of HoS is to build a sustainable, decentralized, and user-owned governance system that can evolve alongside the needs of the NEAR ecosystem.

This documentation explains how House of Stake works, how to get involved, and how it will help shape the future of NEAR governance.

## AI Governance Product Roadmap

# AI Governance Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the current direction of **AI Governance** within **House of Stake**, based on the document [AI Governance Product Roadmap](https://gov.near.org/t/ai-governance-product-roadmap/41683).

It describes three key phases in the evolution of AI-driven governance — **Support, Represent, Organize** — each corresponding to a core product: **Proposal Dashboard**, **Delegate Agent**, and **Manager Agent**.

---

### **Phase 1: Support — Proposal Dashboard**

The first phase focuses on enhancing human participation in governance.
**Proposal Dashboard** is an intelligent platform that helps authors, reviewers, and the community work with proposals more effectively and transparently.

AI capabilities include:
- Evaluating and summarizing proposals based on clarity, completeness, and mission alignment;
- Helping authors refine structure, reasoning, and relevance;
- Supporting reviewers by identifying risks, gaps, and promising ideas.

At this stage, AI acts as a **co-pilot for governance** — augmenting human decision-making rather than replacing it.

---

### **Phase 2: Represent — Delegate Agent**

The second phase introduces **representation through autonomous, customizable AI agents**.
**Delegate Agent** is a transparent AI delegate that participates in voting, informed by Proposal Dashboard evaluations and user-defined principles.

It enables:
- Automated yet auditable participation in governance processes;
- Transparent reasoning and traceable decision logic;
- Personalization and adaptive learning through user feedback.

This phase makes governance **scalable and accessible**, allowing every participant to be represented — even without direct, constant involvement.

---

### **Phase 3: Organize — Manager Agent**

The final phase focuses on **coordination and organizational management** within DAOs.
**Manager Agent** can manage committee membership, roles, and responsibilities in real time, based on objective and transparent criteria.

It enables DAOs to:
- Automate role and membership management;
- Prevent capture and improve accountability;
- Scale through flexible, autonomous decision-making groups.

Here, AI agents don’t replace human judgment — they help determine **who decides and how**, enabling a dynamic, self-organizing governance model.

---

### **Conclusion**

This roadmap defines a pathway for integrating AI into decentralized governance — from support and analysis to autonomous coordination.
**House of Stake** views artificial intelligence as a means to **enhance human participation and transparency**, building the foundation for governance that grows with the ecosystem and its collective values.

---

## Why This Matters

# Why This Matters

Governance is infrastructure.
Without reliable and transparent decision-making, even the best technology and ecosystems can fail.

House of Stake was created in response to the challenges observed in earlier governance efforts — especially around low engagement, slow processes, and poor incentive alignment.

## Key Problems It Aims to Solve

- **Lack of participation:** One-person-one-vote models often result in voter apathy
- **Inefficient execution:** Unclear roles and open-ended debates stall progress
- **Misaligned incentives:** Participants have little reason to stay active or long-term committed
- **Opaque decisions:** Important calls happen off-chain and without community oversight

## Why Stake-Weighted Governance?

Stake-weighted systems, like those powered by veNEAR, align influence with long-term commitment.
They help ensure that governance is shaped by those with meaningful investment in the network's future — not just short-term incentives.

House of Stake isn’t perfect — but it’s a step toward governance that is sustainable, open, and focused on outcomes.

## Delegates & Participants

# Delegates & Participants

In House of Stake, **delegates** play a central role in executing governance on behalf of veNEAR holders. They are trusted participants who vote on proposals, help shape the future of the ecosystem, and are expected to act transparently and responsibly.

## Delegates

Delegates receive voting power when other veNEAR holders delegate their tokens to them. To become a delegate, a user must meet certain requirements and publicly commit to participating in governance.

### Responsibilities

- Vote actively on governance proposals
- Provide rationale for their decisions
- Engage with the community and answer questions
- Comply with the Code of Conduct and avoid conflicts of interest

Delegates may receive **incentives** if they meet participation criteria such as maintaining 80%+ voting activity, regular updates, and holding at least 0.5% of veNEAR.

## Participants

Anyone holding veNEAR can participate in governance directly — by voting, submitting proposals, or delegating their tokens.

Participants can:

- Self-delegate or choose a delegate
- Submit improvement proposals (grants, rules, experiments)
- Join discussions in public governance forums

House of Stake encourages both **direct** and **delegated** participation to ensure flexibility and inclusion.

[Endorsed Delegates](https://gov.near.org/t/announcing-the-initial-set-of-endorsed-delegates/40815?u=kv9990) are officially approved governance participants, selected by the Screening Committee through an open and competitive process. They represent veNEAR holders who choose to delegate their voting power for greater efficiency and coordination in protocol governance.

These delegates reflect a strong mix of experienced individuals and active NEAR-aligned teams, many of whom have contributed to the ecosystem for years.

## Role of Delegates

Participation in House of Stake is permissionless — anyone holding veNEAR can vote directly. However, the delegate system exists to streamline governance for everyday participants by enabling delegation to trusted representatives.

## Expectations & Standards

Endorsed Delegates are expected to:

- Participate in at least 80% of all votes
- Publish public rationales for their decisions
- Provide quarterly updates on the governance forum
- Maintain independence from major conflicts of interest
- Follow the Code of Conduct

In return, they may be eligible for performance-based rewards. The Screening Committee will likely expand the delegate set over time, but the initial group was intentionally kept small to ensure focus and clarity in the early phase.

## Screening Committee

# Screening Committee

The **Screening Committee** is a core governance body within **House of Stake (HoS)**.
It serves as the first layer of review and quality assurance for proposals, delegates, and governance processes — ensuring that all actions align with the **Mission, Vision, and Values** of House of Stake and comply with the **Constitution** and associated charters.

This group acts as a **filter and guardian of integrity**, maintaining a balance between efficiency, transparency, and due diligence.

## Current Status: Interim Screening Committee

The **Interim Screening Committee (ISC)** operates under the mandate of the **NEAR Foundation**, in accordance with the
**[NEAR House of Stake – Screening Committee Charter v0.1.0](https://gov.near.org/t/near-house-of-stake-interim-screening-committee-charter/41689)**.
Its mission is to uphold the integrity, neutrality, and effectiveness of House of Stake governance until a community-elected committee replaces it.

The committee is responsible for:

- Reviewing all submitted proposals within **seven (7) days** of final submission.
- Evaluating proposals based on:
  - Technical feasibility
  - Stakeholder alignment
  - Policy and regulatory compliance
  - Risk management
  - Financial impact
  - Alignment with the HoS Mission, Vision, and Values
- Approving or rejecting proposals for on-chain voting through an **optimistic consent model**:
  if no objections are raised within 24 hours, approval is assumed; if objections occur, a **simple majority vote** is required.
- Managing the approval and removal of **Endorsed Delegates**.
- Publishing all decisions and meeting notes for transparency.The **Screening Committee** is a core governance body within **House of Stake (HoS)**.

## Committee Composition

The Interim Screening Committee consists of **five members**, appointed by the **NEAR Foundation**.
Membership may change during the interim period, and any member may step down with **seven (7) days’ public notice** on the governance forum.

**Current Members:**
- Bianca Guimaraes-Chadwick (NEAR Foundation)
- Lane Rettig (NEAR Foundation)
- Bowen Wang (Near One)
- Gauntlet (1 seat)
- [Fifth seat –  will be added]

The Interim Committee will remain in effect until **May 31, 2026**, or until replaced by a **community-elected Screening Committee** developed in accordance with the process defined in the Constitution (Article 9.2).

---

## What Happens Next

The top priority moving forward is the **transition** from a Foundation-appointed interim body to a **community-elected Screening Committee**.
This process will be implemented through a **co-created replacement charter** and **open elections**.

If this transition is not completed by **May 31, 2026**, the interim committee will automatically **lose its constitutional authority** under the Constitution.

## Transition to a Community-Led Model

After the approval of a **new co-created charter**, community elections will be held to form a **community-elected Screening Committee**.
The interim body will disband immediately after the first election, ensuring a transparent and smooth transition.

---

## Transparency & Accountability

The Screening Committee operates under the **House of Stake Code of Conduct** and the **Constitution**.
All members are expected to uphold principles of transparency, neutrality, and accountability.

## Security Council

# Security Council

The Security Council is a critical governance body responsible for ensuring the security, integrity, and operational resilience of the NEAR protocol. It serves as a final line of defense in the governance architecture of House of Stake, particularly during emergencies or critical protocol upgrades.

## Purpose

The Security Council exists to:

- Respond to urgent threats or security vulnerabilities
- Coordinate emergency actions (e.g., halts, patch deployments)
- Provide oversight during sensitive governance transitions
- Maintain trust in the network during crises

## Structure

The Council is composed of two types of members:

- **Core Members**: Permanent representatives from foundational NEAR ecosystem organizations (e.g., Near Foundation,Near One)
- **Key Members**: Independent or semi-independent contributors with technical or strategic expertise

![Security Council Structure](assets/security-council.png)

This tiered composition ensures both institutional stability and diverse perspectives.

## Responsibilities

- Initiate emergency interventions when necessary
- Inform the community within 7 days after emergency actions
- Monitor proposals for potential malicious behavior
- Coordinate with developers, validators, and governance participants during upgrades
- Oversee technical integrity of the governance system
- Support the Screening Committee in identifying security risks

## Accountability

Security Council members are expected to act in the best interest of the NEAR ecosystem. While their powers are reserved for exceptional circumstances, transparency and clear communication are required after any intervention.

Over time, the Council’s composition and powers may evolve through on-chain governance decisions as the system matures.

## Working Groups Overview

# Working Groups Overview

House of Stake is organized around several specialized Working Groups (WGs), each focused on a core area of governance and ecosystem development.

These groups are responsible for driving discussions, developing strategy, and coordinating execution in their respective domains. While delegates vote on proposals, WGs help shape those proposals and provide the expertise and operational support needed to make governance work.

## Current Working Groups

- **Ecosystem Growth**
  Drive user adoption and engagement, boost liquidity and token utility, expand and retain builders, improve NEAR’s visibility and integration across the stack.

- **Treasury Strategy & Management**
  Effectively utilize NEAR treasury resources.

- **Governance Infrastructure & Processes**
  Draft proposal structure, outline voting procedures & other operational governance processes, work towards defining DAO North Star objectives, break down governance OKRs into actionable items.

- **Network Economics & Security**
  Steward communication between the NEAR community, relevant stakeholders, and Gauntlet — focusing on the implications of a potential reduction of validator issuance on decentralization and validator sustainability.

Each group operates semi-independently, collaborates with delegates, and publishes progress updates regularly.

Community members can engage with WGs through forums, discussions, or proposals.
