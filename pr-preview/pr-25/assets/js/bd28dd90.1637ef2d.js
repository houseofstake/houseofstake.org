Angela will steward NEAR\'s governance evolution at a pivotal moment: [**House of Stake (HoS)**](https://www.near.org/blog/near-house-of-stake-is-now-live-on-mainnet), NEAR\'s next-generation stake-based governance system, has launched on mainnet, introducing veNEAR voting power and aligning long-term participation with meaningful voice in ecosystem decisions.\\n\\nAngela brings a rare combination of startup agility, systems design expertise, and deep governance insight to NEAR.\\n\\nHer perspective is grounded in real-world experience. As she explains:\\n\\n> \\"Finding product-market fit is a hard challenge, and we have yet to prove that DAOs are a superior model for doing so. But if we want to test that premise properly, we must make DAOs not just more democratic, but more effective.\\"\\n\\nFor Angela, decentralized governance is not only about making decisions together. It\'s about making *good* decisions. Every governance action should be evaluated against NEAR\'s North Star:\\n\\n> \\"Is this the best action we can take, in our collective capacity, for NEAR to become **the** blockchain for AI?\\"\\n\\nHer vision for the House of Stake is decentralized coordination that serves the protocol, not itself, driven by product success, pursuit of product-market fit, and measurable achievement. Governance must create **impact**, not inertia.\\n\\n## Role & Mission\\n\\nIn her capacity as Head of Governance, Angela will carry the explicit mission of making House of Stake fully autonomous, anchoring [HoS\'s key mandates](https://gov.near.org/t/house-of-stake-mandate/41652) and steering its journey through the phases of decentralization.\\n\\n**Key mandates for House of Stake:**\\n\\n- **Economic governance:** Treasury management, economic sustainability, and fee switches for AI products, intents, and more.\\n- **Technical governance:** Managing signers for chain signatures and governance matters outside standard GitHub-based processes.\\n- **Legitimacy:** Increasing the amount of NEAR/veNEAR locked in the system and driving broad participation.\\n- **Engagement and ecosystem health:** Fostering stakeholder involvement in governance, the protocol, and the broader NEAR ecosystem.\\n\\nUnder Angela\'s leadership, the mission is clear: to make HoS not just functional, but exemplary. Her role bridges strategy and execution, building the frameworks of autonomy while ensuring the transition remains rigorous, inclusive, and aligned with NEAR\'s long-term goals. She will help shape governance that is resilient, adaptive, and rooted in NEAR\'s vision for an open AI economy where AI serves people, not platforms.\\n\\n## What\'s Next\\n\\nThe launch of House of Stake marks the beginning of a new chapter in NEAR governance. Over the coming months, Angela will help ensure that participation becomes increasingly accessible and meaningful. Governance is open to all NEAR stakeholders, whether they build the core protocol, launch agentic AI, validate the chain, or use products running on NEAR. This is a process of co-creation that strengthens the entire ecosystem.\\n\\n> \\"We\'re building governance not just for NEAR, but with NEAR. Every voice, every vote, every proposal is part of making this ecosystem stronger.\\"\\n> \u2014 Angela Kreitenweis\\n\\n## Get Involved\\n\\n\ud83d\udcd8 Learn more about House of Stake and its mission: [https://houseofstake.org](https://houseofstake.org)\\n\\n\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Get involved in governance: participate, propose, and vote: [https://gov.near.org](https://gov.near.org)\\n\\nTogether, we are laying the groundwork for autonomous, purpose-driven governance, ensuring NEAR continues to lead in building a new kind of internet where AI works for the user."},{"id":"introducing-near-house-of-stake","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-25/blog/introducing-near-house-of-stake","editUrl":"https://github.com/houseofstake/houseofstake.org/tree/main/blog/2025-08-07-introducing-near-house-of-stake.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-07-introducing-near-house-of-stake.md","title":"Introducing NEAR House of Stake: A New Era of Governance","description":"NEAR House of Stake is Live on Mainnet","date":"2025-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":5.83,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"House of Stake","title":"NEAR Governance","url":"https://houseofstake.org","socials":{"x":"https://x.com/neargovernance","github":"https://github.com/houseofstake","telegram":"https://t.me/NEAR_HouseOfStake"},"imageURL":"/pr-preview/pr-25/img/house-of-stake-author.png","key":"houseofstake","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"introducing-near-house-of-stake","title":"Introducing NEAR House of Stake: A New Era of Governance","authors":["houseofstake"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"NEAR Welcomes Angela Kreitenweis as Head of Governance at House of Stake","permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-25/blog/introducing-the-new-head-of-governance"}},"content":"## **NEAR House of Stake is Live on Mainnet**\\n\\nToday, the NEAR Protocol enters a new chapter in its evolution. We\'re proud to announce the mainnet launch of [**House of Stake**](https://gov.houseofstake.org/): a next-generation governance system designed to be transparent, scalable, and adaptive. More than just a tool, it\u2019s the first step in a multi-phase transformation of how NEAR is governed\u2014and, eventually, how governance itself is reimagined.\\n\\n**Phase one**, now underway, is about bootstrapping: building foundational infrastructure, establishing legitimacy, and delivering a functional and accountable system of stake-weighted governance. It\u2019s a pragmatic design, relying on delegated voting and token lockups to ensure long-term alignment: all participants must lock $NEAR, and the longer they lock, the more voting power they receive.\\n\\nIn **phase two**, House of Stake will take on broader responsibilities across the NEAR ecosystem, starting with improving protocol economics. In **phase three**, AI becomes a first-class participant in governance\u2014supporting decision-making, managing workflows, and eventually unlocking new models like \u201cswarm governance,\u201d where intelligent agents can represent the preferences of thousands of stakeholders at once.\\n\\nThis is the foundation for **a new kind of institution**\u2014one that can scale with the network, adapt to its needs, and bring democratic ideals into programmable systems.\\n\\n### **Why House of Stake?**\\n\\nTwo years ago, NEAR\u2019s previous experiment in on-chain governance\u2014the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC)\u2014pushed the boundaries of community-led funding and participation. But it also faced challenges common to a lot of DAOs: low voter turnout, poor incentive design, and limited alignment between stakeholder capital and influence.\\n\\nHouse of Stake is a novel experiment in on-chain governance that incorporates lessons from NDC and other, previous governance experiments. It replaces \u201cone person, one vote\u201d with a flexible, token-locked voting mechanism called **veNEAR** (vote-escrowed NEAR), which strengthens governance influence based on time-locked commitment. Proposals are screened for alignment and quality before going to a vote, and incentives are structured to encourage participation.\\n\\nThis system is designed not only to work\u2014but to evolve. To guide that evolution, we\u2019re actively tracking how it performs\u2014beyond just on-chain metrics.\\n\\n**What does success look like?**\\n\\n- Consistently high delegate participation and proposal engagement\\n\\n- Quality and clarity of proposals passing the screening process\\n\\n- Diverse stakeholder representation (not just whales)\\n\\n- Growing trust in the process, measured through surveys and forum feedback\\n\\n- Effective use of incentives: are rewards driving real contribution or just farming?\\n\\n### **What We Shipped**\\n\\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve worked with the best partner teams in the world to design and ship the House of Stake system. Based on governance [research and design](https://www.gauntlet.xyz/resources/near-house-of-stake-governance-proposal) from our friends at [Gauntlet](https://www.gauntlet.xyz/), built by our friends at [FastNear](https://fastnear.com/) and [Agora](https://agora.xyz/), and with facilitation, integration and product expertise from our friends at [Hack Humanity](https://www.hackhumanity.com/). House of Stake already [live on mainnet](https://gov.houseofstake.org/):\\n\\n- **veNEAR Governance Token**: Users lock NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR to receive veNEAR. The longer the lock, the greater the voting power and rewards. This is a pragmatic approach: stake-weighted governance isn\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s currently the most effective Sybil resistance mechanism available. Our ambition is to evolve toward more democratic and identity-aware models as the technology matures.\\n\\n- **Delegation System**: A curated group of [**Endorsed Delegates**](https://gov.near.org/t/announcing-the-initial-set-of-endorsed-delegates/40815) help scale decision-making. They\u2019re required to maintain high participation rates, disclose their rationale, and act in line with the community\u2019s goals.\\n\\n- **Screening Committee and Security Council**: These oversight bodies ensure that governance is safe, credible, and efficient. The Screening Committee reviews proposals before they go to a vote; the Security Council has a final veto and can act quickly in emergencies.\\n\\n- **On-chain Voting \\\\+ Incentives**: Using NEAR\u2019s 0.5% annual token inflation, as well as future protocol-generated revenue sources (intents, AI infrastructure, etc.), the system funds veNEAR holders, active delegates, and community-approved grant proposals\u2014creating a sustainable, protocol-native governance economy.\\n\\n### **Beyond Token Voting**\\n\\nHouse of Stake was designed from day one to grow into a more expansive system. Here\u2019s a high-level look at what comes next:\\n\\n**Phase One (Now)**:\\n\\n- Launch veNEAR and the on-chain voting system\\n\\n- Community elects the screening committee and begins proposal screening\\n\\n- Distribute early incentives and test mechanisms\\n\\n- Ship foundational infrastructure (contracts, frontend, onboarding, documentation)\\n\\n**Phase Two**:\\n\\n- House of Stake expands its scope: funding more verticals, coordinating more protocol functions\\n\\n- Begins to own protocol economics and budgetary governance\\n\\n- Introduces more robust delegate frameworks, forum tooling, and working groups\\n\\n- Runs on-chain experiments in public goods allocation and participatory budgeting\\n\\n**Phase Three:**\\n\\n- Deep AI integration: agents that help interpret, vote on, and even propose governance actions\\n\\n- Agents are trained on user values and community norms: governance copilots and autonomous delegates\\n\\n- Governance agents represent thousands of users\' preferences, run simulations of policy outcomes, and automatically adjust decisions based on community sentiment\\n\\n- \u201cSwarm governance\u201d: a network of AI actors collaborating on behalf of their human stakeholders, coordinating at scales humans can\u2019t match\\n\\n- Real-world lessons exported to cooperatives, civic networks, and other governance domains\\n\\nThe House of Stake roadmap goes far beyond features. We\u2019re adopting cutting-edge technologies and working at the fringes of what\u2019s possible, and we\u2019ll share the tools we build and the things we learn with the wider world.\\n\\n### **Why It Matters**\\n\\nBlockchains today face a dual legitimacy crisis. On-chain governance often devolves into plutocracy, while off-chain democratic systems are overwhelmed by misinformation and apathy. House of Stake takes both problems seriously and attempts to do something that\u2019s never been done before.\\n\\nBy combining **transparent incentives, structured participation, and AI-augmented tooling**, House of Stake is setting a precedent for governance that works\u2014not just for NEAR, but as a blueprint for the next generation of global, digital institutions.\\n\\nAnd we\u2019re doing it in the open, together, with community participation as both a mechanism and a goal.\\n\\n### **How to Get Involved**\\n\\nParticipation is permissionless, and getting started is easy:\\n\\n- **Lock NEAR into veNEAR** to gain governance power at [gov.houseofstake.org](http://gov.houseofstake.org)\\n\\n- **Read and comment on proposals** on [gov.near.org](https://gov.near.org/)\\n\\n- **Join the discussion** on [Telegram](https://t.me/NEAR_HouseOfStake)\\n\\n- **Follow progress** via [@NEARGovernance](https://x.com/NEARGovernance)\\n\\n- **Become a [delegate](https://gov.houseofstake.org/delegates?filter=endorsed)** by convincing others to delegate their veNEAR to you, or delegate to yourself and simply vote on proposals you care about\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re a validator, a developer, a researcher, or a curious community member, there\u2019s a seat for you in the House. The time to act is now\\\\! The foundations are still being laid, and early participation gives you more than voting power, it gives you influence over the very shape of this system.\\n\\nJoin the network. Read the proposals. Ask questions. Propose ideas. Help House of Stake lead a real on-chain governance revolution. If we succeed, NEAR won\u2019t just be the \u201cblockchain for AI.\u201d It\u2019ll be a proving ground for better institutions everywhere."}]}}')}}]);
