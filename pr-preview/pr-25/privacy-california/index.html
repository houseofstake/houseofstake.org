<p>This section of the privacy policy applies solely to California residents.</p>
<p>We adopt this Section of the privacy policy in order to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“<strong>CPRA</strong>”).</p>
<p>Please note that certain terms used in this California-specific section of the privacy policy, such as “Personal Information,” “Sale,” “Share” and “Sensitive Personal Information” have the meanings given to such terms in the CCPA/CPRA, and not the common meanings of these terms in conversational English. The CCPA does not apply to certain information, which may be subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or certain other state or federal privacy laws.</p>
<p><strong>California Residents</strong></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section § 1798.83, known as the “<em>Shine The Light</em>” law, permits users of the Website, the Apps and the Tools who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding year, and the names and addresses of those third parties. You may request this information no more than once a year, but such request will be handled free of charge to you. To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@houseofstake.org">info@houseofstake.org</a> .</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track and Global Privacy Controls</strong></p>
<p>The Website, the Apps and the Tools respond to currently available global privacy control (“<strong>GPC</strong>”) signals. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Website, the Apps and the Tools up to date so that we can continue to respond to such opt-out request as the technology changes over time</p>
<p>If you choose not to be tracked while visiting the Website, the Apps and the Tools, you can visit your browser privacy settings to make the selection, and specifically turn on a “do not track” or other global privacy control setting made available, to send signals that you wish not to have your information collected as you browse. This election is often available under the cookies related privacy settings for your browser.</p>
<p>Not all browsers have GPC extensions at this time. Please visit the website for the company that offers your browser to see if they have a GPC extension and to learn how to download it. For example, Mozilla explains how to enable their experimental GPC control here: <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2021/10/28/implementing-global-privacy-control/">https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2021/10/28/implementing-global-privacy-control/</a>.</p>

<p>You can exercise all of your rights granted to you pursuant to the CCPA/CPRA by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@houseofstake.org">info@houseofstake.org</a> .</p>
<p>California law requires us to verify your identity before processing your request. In order to make a request pursuant to the CCPA/CPRA, you must provide your NEAR wallet address, associated email address (if applicable), and an email to be used for future communication. If you are requesting specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you, you will also be required to email a signed declaration under penalty of perjury to <a href="mailto:info@houseofstake.org">info@houseofstake.org</a> that you are a California resident and that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request. Note that we will not process your request to disclose specific pieces of information we have about you until we receive this signed declaration, and your request will not be considered timely submitted until this document is in our possession.</p>
<p>We will review the information you have provided against the information in our respective databases, and attempt to verify your identity. However, please note that under certain circumstances, we may require you to provide additional information in order to confirm your identity and your residency before we can process your requests. Also note that you are only entitled to make a Personal Information request up to twice in a 12-month period.</p>
<p>If you submit your CCPA/CPRA request by email, please include “California Privacy Rights” as the subject line. If you make a request to exercise your rights under the CCPA/CPRA by telephone, we may ask you to provide the request in writing so that we may verify your identity.</p>
<p>We will acknowledge your request within 10 days and respond to your request within 45 days or let you know if we need additional time or information to verify your identity (and if so, why).</p>
<p><strong>Using an Authorized Agent</strong></p>
<p>A California resident may use an authorized agent to submit a right to know request, a request to delete, a request to limit our processing of Sensitive Personal Information, or a request to opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information at <a href="mailto:info@houseofstake.org">info@houseofstake.org</a>. To use an authorized agent for these purposes, both the resident and the agent will be required to verify their identities with us. For this purpose, the agent will be required to submit a request with their NEAR wallet address, associated email address (if applicable), and an email to be used for future communication, and the following information about the consumer on whose behalf they are making the request: NEAR wallet address, associated email address (if applicable), and an email to be used for future communication. In addition, the agent will be required to provide via email written authorization from the consumer to act on their behalf in making these requests. If we cannot authenticate the identity of the agent making the request, we may also require that the consumer confirm directly with us that they have in fact authorized their agent to act on their behalf. We may deny a request from an agent who cannot meet these requirements. If the agent has provided a power of attorney pursuant to Cal. Prob. Code Sections 4121 to 4130, then the verification that the consumer has authorized the agent to act on their behalf will not be necessary.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="footer_ibWi"><div class="mainContent_Dq99"><div class="contentWrapper_Jrfb"><div class="brand_bgdd"><h3 class="brandTitle_qKPn">House of Stake</h3></div><div class="linksContainer_G1oe"><div class="section_WW2I"><h4 class="sectionTitle_I2Zr">Social</h4><ul class="linksList_wwW3"><li><a href="https://gov.near.org/c/house-of-stake/158" class="link_bs7K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><img src="/pr-preview/pr-25/img/near-logo.svg" alt="NEAR" width="14" height="14"></span>NEAR Forum</a></li><li><a href="https://gov.houseofstake.org/proposals" class="link_bs7K"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M19 17V5a2 2 0 0 0-2-2H4"></path><path d="M8 21h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-1a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H11a1 1 0 0 0-1 1v1a2 2 0 1 1-4 0V5a2 2 0 1 0-4 0v2a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h3"></path></svg></span>Proposals</a></li><li><a href="/blog#" class="link_bs7K"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M4 19.5v-15A2.5 2.5 0 0 1 6.5 2H19a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v18a1 1 0 0 1-1 1H6.5a1 1 0 0 1 0-5H20"></path><path d="M8 11h8"></path><path d="M8 7h6"></path></svg></span>Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/houseofstake" class="link_bs7K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 496 512" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6 0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6 0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3 0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1 0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4 0 0-70 15-84.7-29.8 0 0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6 0 0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4 0 0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5 0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9 0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4 0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6 0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6 0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9 0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"></path></svg></span>Github</a></li><li><a href="https://x.com/NEARGovernance" class="link_bs7K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M389.2 48h70.6L305.6 224.2 487 464H345L233.7 318.6 106.5 464H35.8L200.7 275.5 26.8 48H172.4L272.9 180.9 389.2 48zM364.4 421.8h39.1L151.1 88h-42L364.4 421.8z"></path></svg></span>Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://t.me/NEAR_HouseOfStake" class="link_bs7K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 496 512" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M248 8C111 8 0 119 0 256s111 248 248 248 248-111 248-248S385 8 248 8zm121.8 169.9l-40.7 191.8c-3 13.6-11.1 16.9-22.4 10.5l-62-45.7-29.9 28.8c-3.3 3.3-6.1 6.1-12.5 6.1l4.4-63.1 114.9-103.8c5-4.4-1.1-6.9-7.7-2.5l-142 89.4-61.2-19.1c-13.3-4.2-13.6-13.3 2.8-19.7l239.1-92.2c11.1-4 20.8 2.7 17.2 19.5z"></path></svg></span>Telegram</a></li></ul></div><div class="section_WW2I"><h4 class="sectionTitle_I2Zr">Legal</h4><ul class="linksList_wwW3"><li><a href="/privacy#" class="link_bs7K">Privacy</a></li><li><a href="/terms#" class="link_bs7K">Terms of Use</a></li><li><a href="/cookies#" class="link_bs7K">Cookie Policy</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="bottomBar_R682"><p class="copyright_ZAtd">© NEAR House of Stake Foundation 2025.
