<ul>
<li>Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Third parties to whom we and our service providers may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets.

<p>We contract with third-party vendors to require that they do not use your personal data for their own purposes and to authorize them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p><strong>International transfers</strong></p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”), Switzerland and the United Kingdom we will endeavour to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<p>We or our service providers will transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions%5C_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions\_en</a>.</p>
<p>Where we or our service providers use certain vendors, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc%5C_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc\_en</a>.</p>

You may: (1) request access to your personal data; (2) request correction of your personal data; (3) request erasure of your personal data; (4) object to processing of your personal data; (5) request restriction of processing your personal data; (6) request transfer of your personal data; or (7) right to withdraw consent by contacting <a href="mailto:info@houseofstake.org">info@houseofstake.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>No fee usually required</strong></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>What we and our service providers may need from you</strong></p>
<p>We and our service providers may need to request specific information from you to help confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights), including your: NEAR wallet address, associated email address (if applicable), and an email to be used for future communication. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We and our service providers may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong>Time limit to respond</strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we or our service providers will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

Note, however, that we and our service providers may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for our and our service providers’ processing of your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want us to establish the data&#x27;s accuracy.</li>
<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want to erase it.</li>
<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it, as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
<li>You have objected to our use of your data but such data is necessary to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We or will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us or our service providers to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we and our service providers may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="footer_ibWi"><div class="mainContent_Dq99"><div class="contentWrapper_Jrfb"><div class="brand_bgdd"><h3 class="brandTitle_qKPn">House of Stake</h3></div><div class="linksContainer_G1oe"><div class="section_WW2I"><h4 class="sectionTitle_I2Zr">Social</h4><ul class="linksList_wwW3"><li><a href="https://gov.near.org/c/house-of-stake/158" class="link_bs7K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><img src="/pr-preview/pr-18/img/near-logo.svg" alt="NEAR" width="14" height="14"></span>NEAR Forum</a></li><li><a href="https://gov.houseofstake.org/proposals" class="link_bs7K"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M19 17V5a2 2 0 0 0-2-2H4"></path><path d="M8 21h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2v-1a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H11a1 1 0 0 0-1 1v1a2 2 0 1 1-4 0V5a2 2 0 1 0-4 0v2a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h3"></path></svg></span>Proposals</a></li><li><a href="/blog#" class="link_bs7K"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M4 19.5v-15A2.5 2.5 0 0 1 6.5 2H19a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v18a1 1 0 0 1-1 1H6.5a1 1 0 0 1 0-5H20"></path><path d="M8 11h8"></path><path d="M8 7h6"></path></svg></span>Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/houseofstake" class="link_bs7K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 496 512" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6 0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6 0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3 0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1 0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4 0 0-70 15-84.7-29.8 0 0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6 0 0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4 0 0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5 0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9 0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4 0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6 0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6 0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9 0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"></path></svg></span>Github</a></li><li><a href="https://x.com/NEARGovernance" class="link_bs7K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M389.2 48h70.6L305.6 224.2 487 464H345L233.7 318.6 106.5 464H35.8L200.7 275.5 26.8 48H172.4L272.9 180.9 389.2 48zM364.4 421.8h39.1L151.1 88h-42L364.4 421.8z"></path></svg></span>Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://t.me/NEAR_HouseOfStake" class="link_bs7K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="linkIcon_Sfx6"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 496 512" height="14" width="14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M248 8C111 8 0 119 0 256s111 248 248 248 248-111 248-248S385 8 248 8zm121.8 169.9l-40.7 191.8c-3 13.6-11.1 16.9-22.4 10.5l-62-45.7-29.9 28.8c-3.3 3.3-6.1 6.1-12.5 6.1l4.4-63.1 114.9-103.8c5-4.4-1.1-6.9-7.7-2.5l-142 89.4-61.2-19.1c-13.3-4.2-13.6-13.3 2.8-19.7l239.1-92.2c11.1-4 20.8 2.7 17.2 19.5z"></path></svg></span>Telegram</a></li></ul></div><div class="section_WW2I"><h4 class="sectionTitle_I2Zr">Legal</h4><ul class="linksList_wwW3"><li><a href="/privacy#" class="link_bs7K">Privacy</a></li><li><a href="/terms#" class="link_bs7K">Terms of Use</a></li><li><a href="/cookies#" class="link_bs7K">Cookie Policy</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="bottomBar_R682"><p class="copyright_ZAtd">© NEAR House of Stake Foundation 2025.
