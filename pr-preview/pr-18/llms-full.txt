## veNEAR Locking Mechanism

# veNEAR Locking Mechanism

To obtain **veNEAR**, users must lock **NEAR**, **stNEAR**, or **liNEAR** tokens in a vote-escrow contract.
The House of Stake governance system supports a **single flexible locking model** that does not require users to commit to a fixed duration.

---

### Locking Model

Users lock tokens without selecting a fixed period.
veNEAR **accumulates linearly over time**, up to a maximum equivalent of 4 years of lock.
Users can initiate an unlock at any time. Once they do, a **3-month cooldown** begins, during which **veNEAR voting power decays to zero**, and tokens become withdrawable at the end.

**Key properties:**

- No fixed period required
- veNEAR accrues gradually (max at 4 years)
- 3-month cooldown after initiating unlock
- Flexible exit at any time

---

### Example: veNEAR Accumulation and Unlock Flow

This mechanism rewards users who consistently keep tokens locked, while still offering the freedom to exit.

1. A user deposits 1 NEAR into the veNEAR contract.
2. veNEAR begins to accrue gradually (e.g., per epoch).
3. After 3 years, the user initiates an unlock.
4. A 3-month cooldown begins — veNEAR linearly decays to 0.
5. After the cooldown ends, the 1 NEAR becomes withdrawable.

![veNEAR Premium and decay calculations for Rolling Lock Approach ](assets/venear-premium-rolling.png)
_veNEAR premium and decay calculations for the locking mechanism_

---

The veNEAR system is built on **stake-weighted and time-based principles**, balancing flexibility with meaningful participation in governance.
It allows users to retain control over their assets while gradually earning influence within the NEAR ecosystem.
The locking model is designed to avoid rigid commitments, while still rewarding long-term alignment and engagement.

---

## Versioning & Evolution

# Versioning & Evolution

House of Stake is designed as an evolving governance system. To stay relevant, it must be able to improve over time — without losing stability or trust.

## On-chain Versioning

Each major governance change (new roles, voting rules, funding mechanisms) is treated as a version upgrade.
These changes are proposed and approved through the same proposal and voting process.

- All version changes are tracked on-chain
- Each version is publicly documented
- Participants can review historical changes and rationale

## Why Versioning Matters

- Promotes transparency and continuity
- Prevents abrupt, undocumented changes
- Creates shared memory for governance evolution

## Community-Driven Iteration

Governance is never "final."
The House of Stake framework is open to experimentation, improvements, and new ideas — as long as they are proposed, reviewed, and voted on transparently.

---

## What is veNEAR

# What is veNEAR

**veNEAR (vote-escrowed NEAR)** is a governance token that allows NEAR holders to participate in House of Stake governance through a stake-weighted, time-locked mechanism.

By locking NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR tokens, users receive veNEAR. The longer the lock duration, the greater the voting power received. This aligns incentives for long-term commitment and active participation.

![veNEAR Flow](assets/venear-flow.png)

## Key Characteristics

- **Non-transferable**: veNEAR cannot be transferred or traded.
- **Time-weighted voting power**: Voting power increases with the duration of the lock — no minimum or maximum period required.
- **Multi-asset support**: Users can lock NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR to receive veNEAR.

## Purpose of veNEAR

- Aligning stakeholders over the long-term to influence the direction of NEAR governance.
- Provide a clear and predictable incentive structure via reward distribution.
- Encourage thoughtful participation and discourage manipulation.

## Why It Matters

veNEAR creates strong alignment between governance power and economic commitment. Those who lock assets for longer periods gain more influence, encouraging responsible, engaged decision-making that supports the long-term health of the NEAR ecosystem.

---

## Governance Philosophy

# Governance Philosophy

The philosophy behind House of Stake is rooted in three principles:

1. **Stake-based legitimacy** — Those with more skin in the game should have more influence. Governance decisions should reflect the interests of long-term ecosystem participants who are economically and reputationally invested in NEAR.

2. **Transparency and accountability** — All governance actions must be traceable, documented, and open to review. Proposals, votes, and delegate activity are recorded on-chain and made publicly accessible.

3. **Efficiency without centralization** — Governance should be fast and effective — without becoming centralized. Pre-screening, delegate specialization, and clear processes help reduce noise while preserving decentralization.

This philosophy is a direct response to the shortcomings of earlier models like the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC), where equal voting rights led to low participation and diluted accountability.

House of Stake aims to strike a balance between **economic alignment**, **open participation**, and **pragmatic execution**, ensuring governance is both meaningful and manageable.

## What is House of Stake

# What is House of Stake

The **House of Stake (HoS)** is a governance framework designed to empower NEAR token holders through a transparent, efficient, and stake-weighted decision-making system.

Instead of a one-person-one-vote model, HoS introduces a more sustainable and long-term approach based on **veNEAR** — a vote-escrowed token that rewards long-term commitment and alignment.

HoS was created to address common challenges in decentralized governance, such as low engagement, lack of transparency, and misaligned incentives.

Key components include:

- **Stake-weighted voting** via veNEAR
- **Pre-screening of proposals** by a Screening Committee
- A **delegate system** with clear roles and aligned incentives
- **Structured funding** sourced from 0.5% protocol inflation
- **On-chain voting** and transparent processes

The vision of HoS is to build a sustainable, decentralized, and user-owned governance system that can evolve alongside the needs of the NEAR ecosystem.

This documentation explains how House of Stake works, how to get involved, and how it will help shape the future of NEAR governance.

## Roadmap and Milestones

## The Future: AI & Scaling

# The Future: AI & Scaling

Governance in crypto is evolving. As networks grow more complex, the systems that manage them must also scale — not just in users and proposals, but in intelligence, autonomy, and resilience.

**House of Stake** is laying the foundation for **next-generation governance**, where tools, agents, and coordination mechanisms matter as much as — if not more than — individual votes.

---

### AI-Assisted Governance

We’re entering an era where governance will be increasingly **AI-augmented**. This doesn’t mean handing the keys over to machines — it means building smarter support systems that make human decision-making more informed, inclusive, and efficient.

#### Phase 1: The Assistant

AI today can already:

- Summarize proposals, flag inconsistencies, and track delegate behavior
- Draft or critique proposals based on protocol context and past examples
- Provide real-time, contextual advice rooted in law, economics, and community norms
- Serve as a "PhD-level co-pilot" for delegates navigating complex ecosystems

The first milestone is embedding such assistants into governance platforms like Agora or Tally — as bots trained on governance archives, protocol mechanics, legal theory, and social norms. These tools can **make participation more accessible**, reduce delegate burnout, and **strengthen accountability**.

#### Phase 2: The Delegate

The logical next step is the **AI delegate** — an autonomous agent that performs most governance functions:

- Reviewing and voting on proposals
- Participating in discussions
- Explaining decisions based on encoded values
- Acting as a low-cost, neutral, always-on stakeholder

Communities could spin up many such agents, each trained with different priorities or behavioral logic. Through experimentation, we’ll learn which models earn **real trust** and deliver real impact.

#### Phase 3: The President

The long-term vision — still speculative — is the **AI president**: a master coordination agent overseeing protocol governance with transparency, neutrality, and continuous availability.

This would require:

- **Checks and balances** — human override mechanisms akin to courts or councils
- **Constituent communication** — infinite parallel conversations, avatar interfaces
- **Ethical design** — fairness, self-restraint, and clear alignment with community will

Whether such a system is desirable or possible depends not just on technical feasibility — but on **social trust** and how we encode governance values into autonomous agents.

> [Three Stages of AI Governance – by Illia Polosukhin & co](https://rettig.substack.com/p/three-stages-of-ai-governance?r=16en&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)

---

### Scalable Infrastructure

To support this evolution, House of Stake promotes:

- **On-chain voting & transparent records** — reducing coordination friction
- **Versioned, modular governance** — enabling safe upgrades and experimentation
- **Automation tools & clear roles** — improving speed and reducing human error

---

### The Vision

House of Stake is not just about fixing governance — it’s about **reinventing it**.

We imagine a future where governance is:

- **User-owned**
- **Agent-assisted**
- **Continuously improving**

The ultimate goal: **governance that scales with the ecosystem** — in **efficiency, inclusiveness, and resilience** — powered by humans and machines working together.

---

## Why This Matters

# Why This Matters

Governance is infrastructure.
Without reliable and transparent decision-making, even the best technology and ecosystems can fail.

House of Stake was created in response to the challenges observed in earlier governance efforts — especially around low engagement, slow processes, and poor incentive alignment.

## Key Problems It Aims to Solve

- **Lack of participation:** One-person-one-vote models often result in voter apathy
- **Inefficient execution:** Unclear roles and open-ended debates stall progress
- **Misaligned incentives:** Participants have little reason to stay active or long-term committed
- **Opaque decisions:** Important calls happen off-chain and without community oversight

## Why Stake-Weighted Governance?

Stake-weighted systems, like those powered by veNEAR, align influence with long-term commitment.
They help ensure that governance is shaped by those with meaningful investment in the network's future — not just short-term incentives.

House of Stake isn’t perfect — but it’s a step toward governance that is sustainable, open, and focused on outcomes.

## Delegates & Participants

# Delegates & Participants

In House of Stake, **delegates** play a central role in executing governance on behalf of veNEAR holders. They are trusted participants who vote on proposals, help shape the future of the ecosystem, and are expected to act transparently and responsibly.

## Delegates

Delegates receive voting power when other veNEAR holders delegate their tokens to them. To become a delegate, a user must meet certain requirements and publicly commit to participating in governance.

### Responsibilities

- Vote actively on governance proposals
- Provide rationale for their decisions
- Engage with the community and answer questions
- Comply with the Code of Conduct and avoid conflicts of interest

Delegates may receive **incentives** if they meet participation criteria such as maintaining 80%+ voting activity, regular updates, and holding at least 0.5% of veNEAR.

## Participants

Anyone holding veNEAR can participate in governance directly — by voting, submitting proposals, or delegating their tokens.

Participants can:

- Self-delegate or choose a delegate
- Submit improvement proposals (grants, rules, experiments)
- Join discussions in public governance forums

House of Stake encourages both **direct** and **delegated** participation to ensure flexibility and inclusion.

[Endorsed Delegates](https://gov.near.org/t/announcing-the-initial-set-of-endorsed-delegates/40815?u=kv9990) are officially approved governance participants, selected by the Screening Committee through an open and competitive process. They represent veNEAR holders who choose to delegate their voting power for greater efficiency and coordination in protocol governance.

---

These delegates reflect a strong mix of experienced individuals and active NEAR-aligned teams, many of whom have contributed to the ecosystem for years.

## Role of Delegates

Participation in House of Stake is permissionless — anyone holding veNEAR can vote directly. However, the delegate system exists to streamline governance for everyday participants by enabling delegation to trusted representatives.

## Expectations & Standards

Endorsed Delegates are expected to:

- Participate in at least 80% of all votes
- Publish public rationales for their decisions
- Provide quarterly updates on the governance forum
- Maintain independence from major conflicts of interest
- Follow the Code of Conduct

In return, they may be eligible for performance-based rewards. The Screening Committee will likely expand the delegate set over time, but the initial group was intentionally kept small to ensure focus and clarity in the early phase.

## Responsibilities and Scope (RACI)

# Responsibilities and Scope (RACI)

This section defines the roles and responsibilities of key governance participants within the House of Stake, using the [RACI matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix):

- **R – Responsible:** Who does the work
- **A – Accountable:** Who is ultimately answerable for the outcome
- **C – Consulted:** Who provides input or expertise
- **I – Informed:** Who must be kept up to date

## Example: Key Governance Processes

| Process                       | Screening Committee | Endorsed Delegates | Delegates | Security Council | veNEAR Holders |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Pre-screening grant proposals | R, A                |                    |           | C                | I              |
| Voting on proposals           |                     | R, A               | R, A      | I                | C, A           |
| Selecting new delegates       | R                   |                    |           | C                | I              |
| Removing bad actors           | R                   |                    |           | C                | I              |
| Emergency intervention        |                     |                    |           | R, A             | I              |
| Updating reward frameworks    | R, A                |                    |           | C                | I              |

> **Note:** This table serves as a starting point. Roles and scopes may evolve as the governance system matures.

## Why RACI Matters

The RACI model clarifies responsibilities, reduces overlap, and increases transparency. It makes complex governance processes easier to understand and more efficient—especially in decentralized environments.

---

## Screening Committee

# Screening Committee

The **Screening Committee** is a core governance body within House of Stake. It acts as the first layer of review and quality control for proposals, delegates, and broader governance processes — ensuring that only aligned, well-formed proposals reach the full voting body.

This group serves as a **filter** and **guardian of integrity**, maintaining a balance between efficiency and due diligence.

---

## Current Status: Interim Screening Committee

To expedite the launch of House of Stake, the **NEAR Foundation** appointed an **Interim Screening Committee**. This temporary body was responsible for launching the delegate process and selecting the **first cohort of Endorsed Delegates**.

### Interim Committee Members

- Bianca Guimaraes-Chadwick (NEAR Foundation)
- Lane Rettig (NEAR Foundation)
- Bowen Wang (Near One)
- Gauntlet (1 seat)

The interim Committee will remain in place **only until** a formal Charter is proposed and approved through governance voting.

---

## What Happens Next

The transition from a Foundation-appointed interim body to a **community-elected Screening Committee** is now the top priority.

### Timeline and Process

1. **Charter Proposal (target: mid-August)**
   The NEAR Foundation will publish a detailed _Screening Committee Charter_ proposal covering:
   - How members are elected, added, or removed
   - Term lengths and rotation
   - Committee responsibilities and accountability mechanisms
   - Committee size and composition
   - The election and replacement process

2. **Election Process**
   After the Charter is approved, elections will be held to form a **new, community-led Screening Committee**.

3. **Sunsetting the Interim Committee**
   The interim body will disband after the first election is complete. **Ensuring this transition** is the committee's highest and final responsibility.

## Community Input & Nominations

The process is open. If you:

Want to **nominate someone** (or yourself) to the future Screening Committee

Have ideas about **how the committee should be structured or elected**

👉 Please share your thoughts in the [forum thread](https://gov.near.org/t/transitioning-the-screening-committee/41490).

This is not yet a formal application process — just a **head start** to surface early ideas and candidates.

---

## Responsibilities of the Screening Committee

### Proposal Review & Governance Flow

- **Pre-screen proposals** before community-wide voting
- **Filter mechanism**: proposals rejected by the Committee (less than 4 out of 7 votes) must achieve a 75% supermajority to pass

### Delegate Selection & Oversight

- **Initiate Calls for Delegates**
- **Select initial Endorsed Delegates**
- **Monitor delegate behavior and voting patterns**
- **Flag conflicts of interest or violations**

### Oversight & Improvement

- **Adjust veNEAR reward incentives** to remain competitive
- **Publish meeting notes and decisions** for transparency
- **Continuously improve frameworks** based on community feedback

### Future Transition

Eventually, as the system matures, the Screening Committee will **transfer the authority to select Endorsed Delegates**, enabling fully community-led governance.

## Security Council

# Security Council

The Security Council is a critical governance body responsible for ensuring the security, integrity, and operational resilience of the NEAR protocol. It serves as a final line of defense in the governance architecture of House of Stake, particularly during emergencies or critical protocol upgrades.

## Purpose

The Security Council exists to:

- Respond to urgent threats or security vulnerabilities
- Coordinate emergency actions (e.g., halts, patch deployments)
- Provide oversight during sensitive governance transitions
- Maintain trust in the network during crises

## Structure

The Council is composed of two types of members:

- **Core Members**: Permanent representatives from foundational NEAR ecosystem organizations (e.g., Near Foundation,Near One)
- **Key Members**: Independent or semi-independent contributors with technical or strategic expertise

![Security Council Structure](assets/security-council.png)

This tiered composition ensures both institutional stability and diverse perspectives.

## Responsibilities

- Initiate emergency interventions when necessary
- Inform the community within 7 days after emergency actions
- Monitor proposals for potential malicious behavior
- Coordinate with developers, validators, and governance participants during upgrades
- Oversee technical integrity of the governance system
- Support the Screening Committee in identifying security risks

## Accountability

Security Council members are expected to act in the best interest of the NEAR ecosystem. While their powers are reserved for exceptional circumstances, transparency and clear communication are required after any intervention.

Over time, the Council’s composition and powers may evolve through on-chain governance decisions as the system matures.

---

## Working Groups Overview

# Working Groups Overview

House of Stake is organized around several specialized Working Groups (WGs), each focused on a core area of governance and ecosystem development.

These groups are responsible for driving discussions, developing strategy, and coordinating execution in their respective domains. While delegates vote on proposals, WGs help shape those proposals and provide the expertise and operational support needed to make governance work.

## Current Working Groups

- **Ecosystem Growth**
  Drive user adoption and engagement, boost liquidity and token utility, expand and retain builders, improve NEAR’s visibility and integration across the stack.

- **Treasury Strategy & Management**
  Effectively utilize NEAR treasury resources.

- **Governance Infrastructure & Processes**
  Draft proposal structure, outline voting procedures & other operational governance processes, work towards defining DAO North Star objectives, break down governance OKRs into actionable items.

- **Network Economics & Security**
  Steward communication between the NEAR community, relevant stakeholders, and Gauntlet — focusing on the implications of a potential reduction of validator issuance on decentralization and validator sustainability.

Each group operates semi-independently, collaborates with delegates, and publishes progress updates regularly.

Community members can engage with WGs through forums, discussions, or proposals.
